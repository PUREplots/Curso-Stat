       "<span style=white-space:pre-wrap>'          What\\r\\nho! what ho! this fellow is dancing mad!He hath been bitten\\r\\nby the Tarantula._ ­All\\r\\nin the Wrong._MANY years ago, I contracted an intimacy\\r\\nwith a Mr. William Legrand.  He was of an ancient\\r\\nHuguenot family, and had once been wealthy; but a\\r\\nseries of misfortunes had reduced him to want. \\r\\nTo avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters,\\r\\nhe left New Orleans, the city of his forefathers,\\r\\nand took up his residence at Sullivan’s Island,\\r\\nnear Charleston, South Carolina.  This Island is\\r\\na very singular one.  It consists of little else\\r\\nthan the sea sand, and is about three miles long. \\r\\nIts breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile. \\r\\nIt is separated from the main land by a scarcely perceptible\\r\\ncreek, oozing its way through a wilderness of reeds\\r\\nand slime, a favorite resort of the marsh hen. \\r\\nThe vegetation, as might be supposed, is scant, or\\r\\nat least dwarfish.  No trees of any magnitude\\r\\nare to be seen.  Near the western extremity, where\\r\\nFort Moultrie stands, and where are some miserable\\r\\nframe buildings, tenanted, during summer, by the fugitives\\r\\nfrom Charleston dust and fever, may be found, indeed,\\r\\nthe bristly palmetto; but the whole island, with the\\r\\nexception of this western point, and a line of hard,\\r\\nwhite beach on the seacoast, is covered with a dense\\r\\nundergrowth of the sweet myrtle, so much prized by\\r\\nthe horticulturists of England.  The shrub here\\r\\noften attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet,\\r\\nand forms an almost impenetrable coppice, burthening\\r\\nthe air with its fragrance.In the inmost recesses of this coppice,\\r\\nnot far from the eastern or more remote end of the\\r\\nisland, Legrand had built himself a small hut, which\\r\\nhe occupied when I first, by mere accident, made his\\r\\nacquaintance.  This soon ripened into friendship ­for\\r\\nthere was much in the recluse to excite interest and\\r\\nesteem.  I found him well educated, with unusual\\r\\npowers of mind, but infected with misanthropy, and\\r\\nsubject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm\\r\\nand melancholy.  He had with him many books, but\\r\\nrarely employed them.  His chief amusements were\\r\\ngunning and fishing, or sauntering along the beach\\r\\nand through the myrtles, in quest of shells or entomological\\r\\nspecimens; ­his collection of the latter\\r\\nmight have been envied by a Swammerdamm.  In these\\r\\nexcursions he was usually accompanied by an old negro,\\r\\ncalled Jupiter, who had been manumitted before the\\r\\nreverses of the family, but who could be induced,\\r\\nneither by threats nor by promises, to abandon what\\r\\nhe considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps\\r\\nof his young “Massa Will.”  It is\\r\\nnot improbable that the relatives of Legrand, conceiving\\r\\nhim to be somewhat unsettled in intellect, had contrived\\r\\nto instil this obstinacy into Jupiter, with a view\\r\\nto the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer.The winters in the latitude of Sullivan’s\\r\\nIsland are seldom very severe, and in the fall of\\r\\nthe year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is\\r\\nconsidered necessary.  About the middle of October,\\r\\n18-, there occurred, however, a day of remarkable\\r\\nchilliness.  Just before sunset I scrambled my\\r\\nway through the evergreens to the hut of my friend,\\r\\nwhom I had not visited for several weeks ­my\\r\\nresidence being, at that time, in Charleston, a distance\\r\\nof nine miles from the Island, while the facilities\\r\\nof passage and re-passage were very far behind those\\r\\nof the present day.  Upon reaching the hut I rapped,\\r\\nas was my custom, and getting no reply, sought for\\r\\nthe key where I knew it was secreted, unlocked the\\r\\ndoor and went in.  A fine fire was blazing upon\\r\\nthe hearth.  It was a novelty, and by no means\\r\\nan ungrateful one.  I threw off an overcoat, took\\r\\nan arm-chair by the crackling logs, and awaited patiently\\r\\nthe arrival of my hosts.Soon after dark they arrived, and\\r\\ngave me a most cordial welcome.  Jupiter, grinning\\r\\nfrom ear to ear, bustled about to prepare some marsh-hens\\r\\nfor supper.  Legrand was in one of his fits ­how\\r\\nelse shall I term them? ­of enthusiasm. \\r\\nHe had found an unknown bivalve, forming a new genus,\\r\\nand, more than this, he had hunted down and secured,\\r\\nwith Jupiter’s assistance, a scarabÃ¦us which\\r\\nhe believed to be totally new, but in respect to which\\r\\nhe wished to have my opinion on the morrow.“And why not to-night?”\\r\\nI asked, rubbing my hands over the blaze, and wishing\\r\\nthe whole tribe of scarabÃ¦i at the devil.“Ah, if I had only known you\\r\\nwere here!” said Legrand, “but it’s\\r\\nso long since I saw you; and how could I foresee that\\r\\nyou would pay me a visit this very night of all others? \\r\\nAs I was coming home I met Lieutenant G ­,\\r\\nfrom the fort, and, very foolishly, I lent him the\\r\\nbug; so it will be impossible for you to see it until\\r\\nthe morning.  Stay here to-night, and I will send\\r\\nJup down for it at sunrise.  It is the loveliest\\r\\nthing in creation!”“What? ­sunrise?”“Nonsense! no! ­the\\r\\nbug.  It is of a brilliant gold color ­about\\r\\nthe size of a large hickory-nut ­with two\\r\\njet black spots near one extremity of the back, and\\r\\nanother, somewhat longer, at the other.  The antennÃ¦\\r\\nare ­”“Dey aint no tin in him, Massa\\r\\nWill, I keep a tellin on you,” here interrupted\\r\\nJupiter; “de bug is a goole bug, solid, ebery\\r\\nbit of him, inside and all, sep him wing ­neber\\r\\nfeel half so hebby a bug in my life.”“Well, suppose it is, Jup,”\\r\\nreplied Legrand, somewhat more earnestly, it seemed\\r\\nto me, than the case demanded, “is that any reason\\r\\nfor your letting the birds burn?  The color” ­here\\r\\nhe turned to me ­“is really almost\\r\\nenough to warrant Jupiter’s idea.  You never\\r\\nsaw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales\\r\\nemit ­but of this you cannot judge till\\r\\ntomorrow.  In the mean time I can give you some\\r\\nidea of the shape.”  Saying this, he seated\\r\\nhimself at a small table, on which were a pen and\\r\\nink, but no paper.  He looked for some in a drawer,\\r\\nbut found none.“Never mind,” said he\\r\\nat length, “this will answer;” and he drew\\r\\nfrom his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to\\r\\nbe very dirty foolscap, and made upon it a rough drawing\\r\\nwith the pen.  While he did this, I retained my\\r\\nseat by the fire, for I was still chilly.  When\\r\\nthe design was complete, he handed it to me without\\r\\nrising.  As I received it, a loud growl was heard,\\r\\nsucceeded by a scratching at the door.  Jupiter\\r\\nopened it, and a large Newfoundland, belonging to Legrand,\\r\\nrushed in, leaped upon my shoulders, and loaded me\\r\\nwith caresses; for I had shown him much attention\\r\\nduring previous visits.  When his gambols were\\r\\nover, I looked at the paper, and, to speak the truth,\\r\\nfound myself not a little puzzled at what my friend\\r\\nhad depicted.“Well!” I said, after\\r\\ncontemplating it for some minutes, “this is a\\r\\nstrange scarabÃ¦us, I must confess:  new to me: \\r\\nnever saw anything like it before ­unless\\r\\nit was a skull, or a death’s-head ­which\\r\\nit more nearly resembles than anything else that has\\r\\ncome under my observation.”“A death’s-head!”\\r\\nechoed Legrand ­“Oh ­yes ­well,\\r\\nit has something of that appearance upon paper, no\\r\\ndoubt.  The two upper black spots look like eyes,\\r\\neh? and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth ­and\\r\\nthen the shape of the whole is oval.”“Perhaps so,” said I;\\r\\n“but, Legrand, I fear you are no artist. \\r\\nI must wait until I see the beetle itself, if I am\\r\\nto form any idea of its personal appearance.”“Well, I don’t know,”\\r\\nsaid he, a little nettled, “I draw tolerably ­should\\r\\ndo it at least ­have had good masters, and\\r\\nflatter myself that I am not quite a blockhead.”“But, my dear fellow, you are\\r\\njoking then,” said I, “this is a very\\r\\npassable skull ­indeed, I may say that it\\r\\nis a very excellent skull, according to the vulgar\\r\\nnotions about such specimens of physiology ­and\\r\\nyour scarabÃ¦us must be the queerest scarabÃ¦us in\\r\\nthe world if it resembles it.  Why, we may get\\r\\nup a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this\\r\\nhint.  I presume you will call the bug scarabÃ¦us\\r\\ncaput hominis, or something of that kind ­there\\r\\nare many similar titles in the Natural Histories. \\r\\nBut where are the antennÃ¦ you spoke of?”“The antennÃ¦!” said Legrand,\\r\\nwho seemed to be getting unaccountably warm upon the\\r\\nsubject; “I am sure you must see the antennÃ¦. \\r\\nI made them as distinct as they are in the original\\r\\ninsect, and I presume that is sufficient.”“Well, well,” I said,\\r\\n“perhaps you have ­still I don’t\\r\\nsee them;” and I handed him the paper without\\r\\nadditional remark, not wishing to ruffle his temper;\\r\\nbut I was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken;\\r\\nhis ill humor puzzled me ­and, as for the\\r\\ndrawing of the beetle, there were positively no antennÃ¦\\r\\nvisible, and the whole did bear a very close resemblance\\r\\nto the ordinary cuts of a death’s-head.He received the paper very peevishly,\\r\\nand was about to crumple it, apparently to throw it\\r\\nin the fire, when a casual glance at the design seemed\\r\\nsuddenly to rivet his attention.  In an instant\\r\\nhis face grew violently red ­in another\\r\\nas excessively pale.  For some minutes he continued\\r\\nto scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat. \\r\\nAt length he arose, took a candle from the table,\\r\\nand proceeded to seat himself upon a sea-chest in\\r\\nthe farthest corner of the room.  Here again he\\r\\nmade an anxious examination of the paper; turning\\r\\nit in all directions.  He said nothing, however,\\r\\nand his conduct greatly astonished me; yet I thought\\r\\nit prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness\\r\\nof his temper by any comment.  Presently he took\\r\\nfrom his coat pocket a wallet, placed the paper carefully\\r\\nin it, and deposited both in a writing-desk, which\\r\\nhe locked.  He now grew more composed in his demeanor;\\r\\nbut his original air of enthusiasm had quite disappeared. \\r\\nYet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted. \\r\\nAs the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed\\r\\nin reverie, from which no sallies of mine could arouse\\r\\nhim.  It had been my intention to pass the night\\r\\nat the hut, as I had frequently done before, but,\\r\\nseeing my host in this mood, I deemed it proper to\\r\\ntake leave.  He did not press me to remain, but,\\r\\nas I departed, he shook my hand with even more than\\r\\nhis usual cordiality.It was about a month after this (and\\r\\nduring the interval I had seen nothing of Legrand)\\r\\nwhen I received a visit, at Charleston, from his man,\\r\\nJupiter.  I had never seen the good old negro look\\r\\nso dispirited, and I feared that some serious disaster\\r\\nhad befallen my friend.“Well, Jup,” said I, “what\\r\\nis the matter now? ­how is your master?”“Why, to speak de troof, massa,\\r\\nhim not so berry well as mought be.”“Not well!  I am truly sorry\\r\\nto hear it.  What does he complain of?”“Dar! dat’s it! ­him\\r\\nneber plain of notin ­but him berry sick\\r\\nfor all dat.”“Very sick, Jupiter! ­why\\r\\ndidn’t you say so at once?  Is he confined\\r\\nto bed?”“No, dat he aint! ­he\\r\\naint find nowhar ­dat’s just whar de\\r\\nshoe pinch ­my mind is got to be berry hebby\\r\\nbout poor Massa Will.”“Jupiter, I should like to understand\\r\\nwhat it is you are talking about.  You say your\\r\\nmaster is sick.  Hasn’t he told you what\\r\\nails him?”“Why, massa, taint worf while\\r\\nfor to git mad about de matter ­Massa Will\\r\\nsay noffin at all aint de matter wid him ­but\\r\\nden what make him go about looking dis here\\r\\nway, wid he head down and he soldiers up, and as white\\r\\nas a gose?  And den he keep a syphon all de time ­”“Keeps a what, Jupiter?”“Keeps a syphon wid de figgurs\\r\\non de slate ­de queerest figgurs I ebber\\r\\ndid see.  Ise gittin to be skeered, I tell you. \\r\\nHab for to keep mighty tight eye pon him noovers. \\r\\nTodder day he gib me slip fore de sun up and was gone\\r\\nde whole ob de blessed day.  I had a\\r\\nbig stick ready cut for to gib him deuced good beating\\r\\nwhen he did come ­but Ise sich a fool\\r\\ndat I hadn’t de heart arter all ­he\\r\\nlook so berry poorly.”“Eh? ­what? ­ah\\r\\nyes! ­upon the whole I think you had better\\r\\nnot be too severe with the poor fellow ­don’t\\r\\nflog him, Jupiter ­he can’t very well\\r\\nstand it ­but can you form no idea of what\\r\\nhas occasioned this illness, or rather this change\\r\\nof conduct?  Has anything unpleasant happened since\\r\\nI saw you?”“No, massa, dey aint bin noffin\\r\\nunpleasant since den ­’twas fore den\\r\\nI’m feared ­’twas de berry day\\r\\nyou was dare.”“How? what do you mean?”“Why, massa, I mean de bug ­dare now.”“The what?”“De bug, ­I’m\\r\\nberry sartain dat Massa Will bin bit somewhere bout\\r\\nde head by dat goole-bug.”“And what cause have you, Jupiter, for such\\r\\na supposition?”“Claws enuff, massa, and mouth\\r\\ntoo.  I nebber did see sick a deuced bug ­he\\r\\nkick and he bite ebery ting what cum near him. \\r\\nMassa Will cotch him fuss, but had for to let him\\r\\ngo gin mighty quick, I tell you ­den was\\r\\nde time he must ha got de bite.  I did n’t\\r\\nlike de look oh de bug mouff, myself, no how, so I\\r\\nwould n’t take hold ob him wid my finger,\\r\\nbut I cotch him wid a piece ob paper dat I found. \\r\\nI rap him up in de paper and stuff piece ob it\\r\\nin he mouff ­dat was de way.”“And you think, then, that your\\r\\nmaster was really bitten by the beetle, and that the\\r\\nbite made him sick?”“I do n’t tink noffin\\r\\nabout it ­I nose it.  What make him dream\\r\\nbout de goole so much, if taint cause he bit by de\\r\\ngoole-bug?  Ise heerd bout dem goole-bugs\\r\\nfore dis.”“But how do you know he dreams about gold?”“How I know? why cause he talk about it in he\\r\\nsleep ­dat’s how I nose.”“Well, Jup, perhaps you are\\r\\nright; but to what fortunate circumstance am I to\\r\\nattribute the honor of a visit from you to-day?”“What de matter, massa?”“Did you bring any message from Mr. Legrand?”“No, massa, I bring dis\\r\\nhere pissel;” and here Jupiter handed me\\r\\na note which ran thus:     MY DEAR   ­Why have I not seen you for so long\\r\\na time?  I hope you have not been so foolish as\\r\\nto take offence at any little brusquerie of\\r\\nmine; but no, that is improbable.  Since I saw\\r\\nyou I have had great cause for anxiety.  I have\\r\\nsomething to tell you, yet scarcely know how to tell\\r\\nit, or whether I should tell it at all.I have not been quite well for some\\r\\ndays past, and poor old Jup annoys me, almost beyond\\r\\nendurance, by his well-meant attentions Would you\\r\\nbelieve it? ­he had prepared a huge stick,\\r\\nthe other day, with which to chastise me for giving\\r\\nhim the slip, and spending the day, solus,\\r\\namong the hills on the main land.  I verily believe\\r\\nthat my ill looks alone saved me a flogging.I have made no addition to my cabinet since we met.If you can, in any way, make it convenient,\\r\\ncome over with Jupiter. Do come.  I wish\\r\\nto see you to-night, upon business of importance. \\r\\nI assure you that it is of the highest importance.        Ever\\r\\nyours,                     WILLIAM LEGRAND.There was something in the tone of\\r\\nthis note which gave me great uneasiness.  Its\\r\\nwhole style differed materially from that of Legrand. \\r\\nWhat could he be dreaming of?  What new crotchet\\r\\npossessed his excitable brain?  What “business\\r\\nof the highest importance” could he possibly\\r\\nhave to transact?  Jupiter’s account of\\r\\nhim boded no good.  I dreaded lest the continued\\r\\npressure of misfortune had, at length, fairly unsettled\\r\\nthe reason of my friend.  Without a moment’s\\r\\nhesitation, therefore, I prepared to accompany the\\r\\nnegro.Upon reaching the wharf, I noticed\\r\\na scythe and three spades, all apparently new, lying\\r\\nin the bottom of the boat in which we were to embark.“What is the meaning of all this, Jup?”\\r\\nI inquired.“Him syfe, massa, and spade.”“Very true; but what are they doing here?”“Him de syfe and de spade what\\r\\nMassa Will sis pon my buying for him in de town, and\\r\\nde debbils own lot of money I had to gib for em.”“But what, in the name of all\\r\\nthat is mysterious, is your ‘Massa Will’\\r\\ngoing to do with scythes and spades?”“Dat’s more dan I\\r\\nknow, and debbil take me if I don’t blieve ’tis\\r\\nmore dan he know, too.  But it’s all\\r\\ncum ob do bug.”Finding that no satisfaction was to\\r\\nbe obtained of Jupiter, whose whole intellect seemed\\r\\nto be absorbed by “de bug,” I now stepped\\r\\ninto the boat and made sail.  With a fair and\\r\\nstrong breeze we soon ran into the little cove to\\r\\nthe northward of Fort Moultrie, and a walk of some\\r\\ntwo miles brought us to the hut.  It was about\\r\\nthree in the afternoon when we arrived.  Legrand\\r\\nhad been awaiting us in eager expectation.  He\\r\\ngrasped my hand with a nervous empressement which\\r\\nalarmed me and strengthened the suspicions already\\r\\nentertained.  His countenance was pale even to\\r\\nghastliness, and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural\\r\\nlustre.  After some inquiries respecting his health,\\r\\nI asked him, not knowing what better to say, if he\\r\\nhad yet obtained the scarabÃ¦us from Lieutenant G\\r\\n  .“Oh, yes,” he replied,\\r\\ncoloring violently, “I got it from him the next\\r\\nmorning.  Nothing should tempt me to part with\\r\\nthat scarabÃ¦us.  Do you know that Jupiter is\\r\\nquite right about it?”“In what way?” I asked, with a sad foreboding\\r\\nat heart.“In supposing it to be a bug\\r\\nof real gold.”  He said this with an air\\r\\nof profound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly\\r\\nshocked.“This bug is to make my fortune,”\\r\\nhe continued, with a triumphant smile, “to reinstate\\r\\nme in my family possessions.  Is it any wonder,\\r\\nthen, that I prize it?  Since Fortune has thought\\r\\nfit to bestow it upon me, I have only to use it properly\\r\\nand I shall arrive at the gold of which it is the\\r\\nindex.  Jupiter; bring me that scarabÃ¦us!”“What! de bug, massa?  I’d\\r\\nrudder not go fer trubble dat bug ­you\\r\\nmus git him for your own self.” \\r\\nHereupon Legrand arose, with a grave and stately air,\\r\\nand brought me the beetle from a glass case in which\\r\\nit was enclosed.  It was a beautiful scarabÃ¦us,\\r\\nand, at that time, unknown to naturalists ­of\\r\\ncourse a great prize in a scientific point of view. \\r\\nThere were two round, black spots near one extremity\\r\\nof the back, and a long one near the other.  The\\r\\nscales were exceedingly hard and glossy, with all\\r\\nthe appearance of burnished gold.  The weight of\\r\\nthe insect was very remarkable, and, taking all things\\r\\ninto consideration, I could hardly blame Jupiter for\\r\\nhis opinion respecting it; but what to make of Legrand’s\\r\\nconcordance with that opinion, I could not, for the\\r\\nlife of me, tell.“I sent for you,” said\\r\\nhe, in a grandiloquent tone, when I had completed\\r\\nmy examination of the beetle, “I sent for you,\\r\\nthat I might have your counsel and assistance in furthering\\r\\nthe views of Fate and of the bug” ­“My dear Legrand,” I cried,\\r\\ninterrupting him, “you are certainly unwell,\\r\\nand had better use some little precautions.  You\\r\\nshall go to bed, and I will remain with you a few\\r\\ndays, until you get over this.  You are feverish\\r\\nand” ­“Feel my pulse,” said he.I felt it, and, to say the truth,\\r\\nfound not the slightest indication of fever.“But you may be ill and yet\\r\\nhave no fever.  Allow me this once to prescribe\\r\\nfor you.  In the first place, go to bed.  In\\r\\nthe next” ­“You are mistaken,” he\\r\\ninterposed, “I am as well as I can expect to\\r\\nbe under the excitement which I suffer.  If you\\r\\nreally wish me well, you will relieve this excitement.”“And how is this to be done?”“Very easily.  Jupiter and\\r\\nmyself are going upon an expedition into the hills,\\r\\nupon the main land, and, in this expedition we shall\\r\\nneed the aid of some person in whom we can confide. \\r\\nYou are the only one we can trust.  Whether we\\r\\nsucceed or fail, the excitement which you now perceive\\r\\nin me will be equally allayed.”“I am anxious to oblige you\\r\\nin any way,” I replied; “but do you mean\\r\\nto say that this infernal beetle has any connection\\r\\nwith your expedition into the hills?”“It has.”“Then, Legrand, I can become a party to no such\\r\\nabsurd proceeding.”“I am sorry ­very sorry ­for\\r\\nwe shall have to try it by ourselves.”“Try it by yourselves! \\r\\nThe man is surely mad! ­but stay! ­how\\r\\nlong do you propose to be absent?”“Probably all night.  We\\r\\nshall start immediately, and be back, at all events,\\r\\nby sunrise.”“And will you promise me, upon\\r\\nyour honor, that when this freak of yours is over,\\r\\nand the bug business (good God!) settled to your satisfaction,\\r\\nyou will then return home and follow my advice implicitly,\\r\\nas that of your physician?”“Yes; I promise; and now let\\r\\nus be off, for we have no time to lose.”With a heavy heart I accompanied my\\r\\nfriend.  We started about four o’clock ­Legrand,\\r\\nJupiter, the dog, and myself.  Jupiter had with\\r\\nhim the scythe and spades ­the whole of\\r\\nwhich he insisted upon carrying ­more through\\r\\nfear, it seemed to me, of trusting either of the implements\\r\\nwithin reach of his master, than from any excess of\\r\\nindustry or complaisance.  His demeanor was dogged\\r\\nin the extreme, and “dat deuced bug” were\\r\\nthe sole words which escaped his lips during the journey. \\r\\nFor my own part, I had charge of a couple of dark\\r\\nlanterns, while Legrand contented himself with the\\r\\nscarabÃ¦us, which he carried attached to the end of\\r\\na bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and fro, with the\\r\\nair of a conjuror, as he went.  When I observed\\r\\nthis last, plain evidence of my friend’s aberration\\r\\nof mind, I could scarcely refrain from tears. \\r\\nI thought it best, however, to humor his fancy, at\\r\\nleast for the present, or until I could adopt some\\r\\nmore energetic measures with a chance of success. \\r\\nIn the mean time I endeavored, but all in vain, to\\r\\nsound him in regard to the object of the expedition. \\r\\nHaving succeeded in inducing me to accompany him,\\r\\nhe seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any\\r\\ntopic of minor importance, and to all my questions\\r\\nvouchsafed no other reply than “we shall see!”We crossed the creek at the head of\\r\\nthe island by means of a skiff; and, ascending the\\r\\nhigh grounds on the shore of the main land, proceeded\\r\\nin a northwesterly direction, through a tract of country\\r\\nexcessively wild and desolate, where no trace of a\\r\\nhuman footstep was to be seen.  Legrand led the\\r\\nway with decision; pausing only for an instant, here\\r\\nand there, to consult what appeared to be certain\\r\\nlandmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion.In this manner we journeyed for about\\r\\ntwo hours, and the sun was just setting when we entered\\r\\na region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen. \\r\\nIt was a species of table land, near the summit of\\r\\nan almost inaccessible hill, densely wooded from base\\r\\nto pinnacle, and interspersed with huge crags that\\r\\nappeared to lie loosely upon the soil, and in many\\r\\ncases were prevented from precipitating themselves\\r\\ninto the valleys below, merely by the support of the\\r\\ntrees against which they reclined.  Deep ravines,\\r\\nin various directions, gave an air of still sterner\\r\\nsolemnity to the scene.The natural platform to which we had\\r\\nclambered was thickly overgrown with brambles, through\\r\\nwhich we soon discovered that it would have been impossible\\r\\nto force our way but for the scythe; and Jupiter, by\\r\\ndirection of his master, proceeded to clear for us\\r\\na path to the foot of an enormously tall tulip-tree,\\r\\nwhich stood, with some eight or ten oaks, upon the\\r\\nlevel, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees\\r\\nwhich I had then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage\\r\\nand form, in the wide spread of its branches, and\\r\\nin the general majesty of its appearance.  When\\r\\nwe reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and\\r\\nasked him if he thought he could climb it.  The\\r\\nold man seemed a little staggered by the question,\\r\\nand for some moments made no reply.  At length\\r\\nhe approached the huge trunk, walked slowly around\\r\\nit, and examined it with minute attention.  When\\r\\nhe had completed his scrutiny, he merely said,“Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he ebber see\\r\\nin he life.”“Then up with you as soon as\\r\\npossible, for it will soon be too dark to see what\\r\\nwe are about.”“How far mus go up, massa?”\\r\\ninquired Jupiter.“Get up the main trunk first,\\r\\nand then I will tell you which way to go ­and\\r\\nhere ­stop! take this beetle with you.”“De bug, Massa Will! ­de\\r\\ngoole bug!” cried the negro, drawing back in\\r\\ndismay ­“what for mus tote de\\r\\nbug way up de tree? ­d-n if I do!”“If you are afraid, Jup, a great\\r\\nbig negro like you, to take hold of a harmless little\\r\\ndead beetle, why you can carry it up by this string ­but,\\r\\nif you do not take it up with you in some way, I shall\\r\\nbe under the necessity of breaking your head with\\r\\nthis shovel.”“What de matter now, massa?”\\r\\nsaid Jup, evidently shamed into compliance; “always\\r\\nwant for to raise fuss wid old nigger.  Was only\\r\\nfunnin any how.  Me feered de bug! what I keer\\r\\nfor de bug?” Here he took cautiously hold of\\r\\nthe extreme end of the string, and, maintaining the\\r\\ninsect as far from his person as circumstances would\\r\\npermit, prepared to ascend the tree.In youth, the tulip-tree, or Liriodendron\\r\\nTulipferum, the most magnificent of American foresters,\\r\\nhas a trunk peculiarly smooth, and often rises to\\r\\na great height without lateral branches; but, in its\\r\\nriper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while\\r\\nmany short limbs make their appearance on the stem. \\r\\nThus the difficulty of ascension, in the present case,\\r\\nlay more in semblance than in reality.  Embracing\\r\\nthe huge cylinder, as closely as possible, with his\\r\\narms and knees, seizing with his hands some projections,\\r\\nand resting his naked toes upon others, Jupiter, after\\r\\none or two narrow escapes from falling, at length\\r\\nwriggled himself into the first great fork, and seemed\\r\\nto consider the whole business as virtually accomplished. \\r\\nThe risk of the achievement was, in fact, now over,\\r\\nalthough the climber was some sixty or seventy feet\\r\\nfrom the ground.“Which way mus go now, Massa Will?”\\r\\nhe asked.“Keep up the largest branch ­the\\r\\none on this side,” said Legrand.  The negro\\r\\nobeyed him promptly, and apparently with but little\\r\\ntrouble; ascending higher and higher, until no glimpse\\r\\nof his squat figure could be obtained through the\\r\\ndense foliage which enveloped it.  Presently his\\r\\nvoice was heard in a sort of halloo.“How much fudder is got for go?”“How high up are you?” asked Legrand.“Ebber so fur,” replied\\r\\nthe negro; “can see de sky fru de top ob\\r\\nde tree.”“Never mind the sky, but attend\\r\\nto what I say.  Look down the trunk and count\\r\\nthe limbs below you on this side.  How many limbs\\r\\nhave you passed?”“One, two, tree, four, fibe ­I\\r\\ndone pass fibe big limb, massa, pon dis\\r\\nside.”“Then go one limb higher.”In a few minutes the voice was heard\\r\\nagain, announcing that the seventh limb was attained.“Now, Jup,” cried Legrand,\\r\\nevidently much excited, “I want you to work\\r\\nyour way out upon that limb as far as you can. \\r\\nIf you see anything strange, let me know.” \\r\\nBy this time what little doubt I might have entertained\\r\\nof my poor friend’s insanity, was put finally\\r\\nat rest.  I had no alternative but to conclude\\r\\nhim stricken with lunacy, and I became seriously anxious\\r\\nabout getting him home.  While I was pondering\\r\\nupon what was best to be done, Jupiter’s voice\\r\\nwas again heard.“Mos feerd for to ventur pon\\r\\ndis limb berry far ­tis dead limb putty\\r\\nmuch all de way.”“Did you say it was a dead limb,\\r\\nJupiter?” cried Legrand in a quavering voice.“Yes, massa, him dead as de\\r\\ndoor-nail ­done up for sartain ­done\\r\\ndeparted dis here life.”“What in the name heaven shall\\r\\nI do?” asked Legrand, seemingly in the greatest\\r\\ndistress.  “Do!” said I, glad of an\\r\\nopportunity to interpose a word, “why come home\\r\\nand go to bed.  Come now! ­that’s\\r\\na fine fellow.  It’s getting late, and,\\r\\nbesides, you remember your promise.”“Jupiter,” cried he, without\\r\\nheeding me in the least, “do you hear me?”“Yes, Massa Will, hear you ebber so plain.”“Try the wood well, then, with\\r\\nyour knife, and see if you think it very rotten.”“Him rotten, massa, sure nuff,”\\r\\nreplied the negro in a few moments, “but not\\r\\nso berry rotten as mought be.  Mought ventur out\\r\\nleetle way pon de limb by myself, dat’s true.”“By yourself! ­what do you mean?”“Why I mean de bug.  ’Tis\\r\\nberry hebby bug.  Spose I drop him down fuss,\\r\\nand den de limb won’t break wid just de weight\\r\\nob one nigger.”“You infernal scoundrel!”\\r\\ncried Legrand, apparently much relieved, “what\\r\\ndo you mean by telling me such nonsense as that? \\r\\nAs sure as you drop that beetle I’ll break your\\r\\nneck.  Look here, Jupiter, do you hear me?”“Yes, massa, needn’t hollo at poor nigger\\r\\ndat style.”“Well! now listen! ­if\\r\\nyou will venture out on the limb as far as you think\\r\\nsafe, and not let go the beetle, I’ll make you\\r\\na present of a silver dollar as soon as you get down.”“I’m gwine, Massa Will ­deed\\r\\nI is,” replied the negro very promptly ­“mos\\r\\nout to the eend now.”“Out to the end!” here\\r\\nfairly screamed Legrand, “do you say you are\\r\\nout to the end of that limb?”“Soon be to de eend, massa, ­o-o-o-o-oh! \\r\\nLor-gol-a-marcy! what is dis here pon de\\r\\ntree?”“Well!” cried Legrand, highly delighted,\\r\\n“what is it?”“Why taint noffin but a skull ­somebody\\r\\nbin lef him head up de tree, and de crows done gobble\\r\\nebery bit ob de meat off.”“A skull, you say! ­very\\r\\nwell! ­how is it fastened to the limb? ­what\\r\\nholds it on?”“Sure nuff, massa; mus\\r\\nlook.  Why dis berry curous sarcumstance,\\r\\npon my word ­dare’s a great big nail\\r\\nin de skull, what fastens ob it on to de tree.”“Well now, Jupiter, do exactly\\r\\nas I tell you ­do you hear?”“Yes, massa.”“Pay attention, then! ­find the left\\r\\neye of the skull.”“Hum! hoo! dat’s good! why dare aint no\\r\\neye lef at all.”“Curse your stupidity! do you know your right\\r\\nhand from your left?”“Yes, I nose dat ­nose\\r\\nall bout dat ­tis my lef hand what I chops\\r\\nde wood wid.”“To be sure! you are left-handed;\\r\\nand your left eye is on the same side as your left\\r\\nhand.  Now, I suppose, you can find the left eye\\r\\nof the skull, or the place where the left eye has\\r\\nbeen.  Have you found it?”Here was a long pause.  At length the negro asked,“Is de lef eye of de skull pon\\r\\nde same side as de lef hand of de skull, too? ­cause\\r\\nde skull aint got not a bit ob a hand at all ­nebber\\r\\nmind!  I got de lef eye now ­here de\\r\\nlef eye! what mus do wid it?”“Let the beetle drop through\\r\\nit, as far as the string will reach ­but\\r\\nbe careful and not let go your hold of the string.”“All dat done, Massa Will; mighty\\r\\neasy ting for to put de bug fru de hole ­look\\r\\nout for him dare below!”During this colloquy no portion of\\r\\nJupiter’s person could be seen; but the beetle,\\r\\nwhich he had suffered to descend, was now visible at\\r\\nthe end of the string, and glistened, like a globe\\r\\nof burnished gold, in the last rays of the setting\\r\\nsun, some of which still faintly illumined the eminence\\r\\nupon which we stood.  The scarabÃ¦us hung quite\\r\\nclear of any branches, and, if allowed to fall, would\\r\\nhave fallen at our feet.  Legrand immediately\\r\\ntook the scythe, and cleared with it a circular space,\\r\\nthree or four yards in diameter, just beneath the insect,\\r\\nand, having accomplished this, ordered Jupiter to\\r\\nlet go the string and come down from the tree.Driving a peg, with great nicety,\\r\\ninto the ground, at the precise spot where the beetle\\r\\nfell, my friend now produced from his pocket a tape\\r\\nmeasure.  Fastening one end of this at that point\\r\\nof the trunk, of the tree which was nearest the peg,\\r\\nhe unrolled it till it reached the peg, and thence\\r\\nfarther unrolled it, in the direction already established\\r\\nby the two points of the tree and the peg, for the\\r\\ndistance of fifty feet ­Jupiter clearing\\r\\naway the brambles with the scythe.  At the spot\\r\\nthus attained a second peg was driven, and about this,\\r\\nas a centre, a rude circle, about four feet in diameter,\\r\\ndescribed.  Taking now a spade himself, and giving\\r\\none to Jupiter and one to me, Legrand begged us to\\r\\nset about digging as quickly as possible.To speak the truth, I had no especial\\r\\nrelish for such amusement at any time, and, at that\\r\\nparticular moment, would most willingly have declined\\r\\nit; for the night was coming on, and I felt much fatigued\\r\\nwith the exercise already taken; but I saw no mode\\r\\nof escape, and was fearful of disturbing my poor friend’s\\r\\nequanimity by a refusal.  Could I have depended,\\r\\nindeed, upon Jupiter’s aid, I would have had\\r\\nno hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home\\r\\nby force; but I was too well assured of the old negro’s\\r\\ndisposition, to hope that he would assist me, under\\r\\nany circumstances, in a personal contest with his master. \\r\\nI made no doubt that the latter had been infected\\r\\nwith some of the innumerable Southern superstitions\\r\\nabout money buried, and that his phantasy had received\\r\\nconfirmation by the finding of the scarabÃ¦us, or,\\r\\nperhaps, by Jupiter’s obstinacy in maintaining\\r\\nit to be “a bug of real gold.”  A\\r\\nmind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by\\r\\nsuch suggestions ­especially if chiming\\r\\nin with favorite preconceived ideas ­and\\r\\nthen I called to mind the poor fellow’s speech\\r\\nabout the beetle’s being “the index of\\r\\nhis fortune.”  Upon the whole, I was sadly\\r\\nvexed and puzzled, but, at length, I concluded to make\\r\\na virtue of necessity ­to dig with a good\\r\\nwill, and thus the sooner to convince the visionary,\\r\\nby ocular demonstration, of the fallacy of the opinions\\r\\nhe entertained.The lanterns having been lit, we all\\r\\nfell to work with a zeal worthy a more rational cause;\\r\\nand, as the glare fell upon our persons and implements,\\r\\nI could not help thinking how picturesque a group we\\r\\ncomposed, and how strange and suspicious our labors\\r\\nmust have appeared to any interloper who, by chance,\\r\\nmight have stumbled upon our whereabouts.We dug very steadily for two hours. \\r\\nLittle was said; and our chief embarrassment lay in\\r\\nthe yelpings of the dog, who took exceeding interest\\r\\nin our proceedings.  He, at length, became so obstreperous\\r\\nthat we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some\\r\\nstragglers in the vicinity; ­or, rather,\\r\\nthis was the apprehension of Legrand; ­for\\r\\nmyself, I should have rejoiced at any interruption\\r\\nwhich might have enabled me to get the wanderer home. \\r\\nThe noise was, at length, very effectually silenced\\r\\nby Jupiter, who, getting out of the hole with a dogged\\r\\nair of deliberation, tied the brute’s mouth up\\r\\nwith one of his suspenders, and then returned, with\\r\\na grave chuckle, to his task.When the time mentioned had expired,\\r\\nwe had reached a depth of five feet, and yet no signs\\r\\nof any treasure became manifest.  A general pause\\r\\nensued, and I began to hope that the farce was at an\\r\\nend.  Legrand, however, although evidently much\\r\\ndisconcerted, wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced. \\r\\nWe had excavated the entire circle of four feet diameter,\\r\\nand now we slightly enlarged the limit, and went to\\r\\nthe farther depth of two feet.  Still nothing\\r\\nappeared.  The gold-seeker, whom I sincerely pitied,\\r\\nat length clambered from the pit, with the bitterest\\r\\ndisappointment imprinted upon every feature, and proceeded,\\r\\nslowly and reluctantly, to put on his coat, which\\r\\nhe had thrown off at the beginning of his labor. \\r\\nIn the mean time I made no remark.  Jupiter, at\\r\\na signal from his master, began to gather up his tools. \\r\\nThis done, and the dog having been unmuzzled, we turned\\r\\nin profound silence towards home.We had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps\\r\\nin this direction, when, with a loud oath, Legrand\\r\\nstrode up to Jupiter, and seized him by the collar. \\r\\nThe astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the\\r\\nfullest extent, let fall the spades, and fell upon\\r\\nhis knees.“You scoundrel,” said\\r\\nLegrand, hissing out the syllables from between his\\r\\nclenched teeth ­“you infernal black\\r\\nvillain! ­speak, I tell you! ­answer\\r\\nme this instant, without prevarication! ­which ­which\\r\\nis your left eye?”“Oh, my golly, Massa Will! aint\\r\\ndis here my lef eye for sartain?” roared\\r\\nthe terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his right\\r\\norgan of vision, and holding it there with a desperate\\r\\npertinacity, as if in immediate dread of his master’s\\r\\nattempt at a gouge.“I thought so! ­I\\r\\nknew it! hurrah!” vociferated Legrand, letting\\r\\nthe negro go, and executing a series of curvets and\\r\\ncaracols, much to the astonishment of his valet, who,\\r\\narising from his knees, looked, mutely, from his master\\r\\nto myself, and then from myself to his master.“Come! we must go back,”\\r\\nsaid the latter, “the game’s not up yet;”\\r\\nand he again led the way to the tulip-tree.“Jupiter,” said he, when\\r\\nwe reached its foot, “come here! was the skull\\r\\nnailed to the limb with the face outwards, or with\\r\\nthe face to the limb?”“De face was out, massa, so\\r\\ndat de crows could get at de eyes good, widout any\\r\\ntrouble.”“Well, then, was it this eye\\r\\nor that through which you dropped the beetle?” ­here\\r\\nLegrand touched each of Jupiter’s eyes.“Twas dis eye, massa ­de\\r\\nlef eye ­jis as you tell me,” and here\\r\\nit was his right eye that the negro indicated.“That will do ­must try it again.”Here my friend, about whose madness\\r\\nI now saw, or fancied that I saw, certain indications\\r\\nof method, removed the peg which marked the spot where\\r\\nthe beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to the\\r\\nwestward of its former position.  Taking, now,\\r\\nthe tape measure from the nearest point of the trunk\\r\\nto the peg, as before, and continuing the extension\\r\\nin a straight line to the distance of fifty feet, a\\r\\nspot was indicated, removed, by several yards, from\\r\\nthe point at which we had been digging.Around the new position a circle,\\r\\nsomewhat larger than in the former instance, was now\\r\\ndescribed, and we again set to work with the spades. \\r\\nI was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding\\r\\nwhat had occasioned the change in my thoughts, I felt\\r\\nno longer any great aversion from the labor imposed. \\r\\nI had become most unaccountably interested ­nay,\\r\\neven excited.  Perhaps there was something, amid\\r\\nall the extravagant demeanor of Legrand ­some\\r\\nair of forethought, or of deliberation, which impressed\\r\\nme.  I dug eagerly, and now and then caught myself\\r\\nactually looking, with something that very much resembled\\r\\nexpectation, for the fancied treasure, the vision\\r\\nof which had demented my unfortunate companion. \\r\\nAt a period when such vagaries of thought most fully\\r\\npossessed me, and when we had been at work perhaps\\r\\nan hour and a half, we were again interrupted by the\\r\\nviolent howlings of the dog.  His uneasiness, in\\r\\nthe first instance, had been, evidently, but the result\\r\\nof playfulness or caprice, but he now assumed a bitter\\r\\nand serious tone.  Upon Jupiter’s again\\r\\nattempting to muzzle him, he made furious resistance,\\r\\nand, leaping into the hole, tore up the mould frantically\\r\\nwith his claws.  In a few seconds he had uncovered\\r\\na mass of human bones, forming two complete skeletons,\\r\\nintermingled with several buttons of metal, and what\\r\\nappeared to be the dust of decayed woollen.  One\\r\\nor two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a\\r\\nlarge Spanish knife, and, as we dug farther, three\\r\\nor four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to\\r\\nlight.At sight of these the joy of Jupiter\\r\\ncould scarcely be restrained, but the countenance\\r\\nof his master wore an air of extreme disappointment\\r\\nHe urged us, however, to continue our exertions, and\\r\\nthe words were hardly uttered when I stumbled and\\r\\nfell forward, having caught the toe of my boot in\\r\\na large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose\\r\\nearth.We now worked in earnest, and never\\r\\ndid I pass ten minutes of more intense excitement. \\r\\nDuring this interval we had fairly unearthed an oblong\\r\\nchest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation\\r\\nand wonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected\\r\\nto some mineralizing process ­perhaps that\\r\\nof the Bi-chloride of Mercury.  This box was three\\r\\nfeet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and\\r\\na half feet deep.  It was firmly secured by bands\\r\\nof wrought iron, riveted, and forming a kind of open\\r\\ntrelliswork over the whole.  On each side of the\\r\\nchest, near the top, were three rings of iron ­six\\r\\nin all ­by means of which a firm hold could\\r\\nbe obtained by six persons.  Our utmost united\\r\\nendeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly\\r\\nin its bed.  We at once saw the impossibility\\r\\nof removing so great a weight.  Luckily, the sole\\r\\nfastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts. \\r\\nThese we drew back ­trembling and panting\\r\\nwith anxiety.  In an instant, a treasure of incalculable\\r\\nvalue lay gleaming before us.  As the rays of the\\r\\nlanterns fell within the pit, there flashed upwards\\r\\na glow and a glare, from a confused heap of gold and\\r\\nof jewels, that absolutely dazzled our eyes.I shall not pretend to describe the\\r\\nfeelings with which I gazed.  Amazement was, of\\r\\ncourse, predominant.  Legrand appeared exhausted\\r\\nwith excitement, and spoke very few words.  Jupiter’s\\r\\ncountenance wore, for some minutes, as deadly a pallor\\r\\nas it is possible, in nature of things, for any negro’s\\r\\nvisage to assume.  He seemed stupified ­thunderstricken. \\r\\nPresently he fell upon his knees in the pit, and, burying\\r\\nhis naked arms up to the elbows in gold, let them\\r\\nthere remain, as if enjoying the luxury of a bath. \\r\\nAt length, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in\\r\\na soliloquy,“And dis all cum ob\\r\\nde goole-bug! de putty goole bug! de poor little\\r\\ngoole-bug, what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob\\r\\nstyle!  Aint you shamed ob yourself, nigger? ­answer\\r\\nme dat!”It became necessary, at last, that\\r\\nI should arouse both master and valet to the expediency\\r\\nof removing the treasure.  It was growing late,\\r\\nand it behooved us to make exertion, that we might\\r\\nget every thing housed before daylight.  It was\\r\\ndifficult to say what should be done, and much time\\r\\nwas spent in deliberation ­so confused were\\r\\nthe ideas of all.  We, finally, lightened the\\r\\nbox by removing two thirds of its contents, when we\\r\\nwere enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from the\\r\\nhole.  The articles taken out were deposited among\\r\\nthe brambles, and the dog left to guard them, with\\r\\nstrict orders from Jupiter neither, upon any pretence,\\r\\nto stir from the spot, nor to open his mouth until\\r\\nour return.  We then hurriedly made for home with\\r\\nthe chest; reaching the hut in safety, but after excessive\\r\\ntoil, at one o’clock in the morning.  Worn\\r\\nout as we were, it was not in human nature to do more\\r\\nimmediately.  We rested until two, and had supper;\\r\\nstarting for the hills immediately afterwards, armed\\r\\nwith three stout sacks, which, by good luck, were upon\\r\\nthe premises.  A little before four we arrived\\r\\nat the pit, divided the remainder of the booty, as\\r\\nequally as might be, among us, and, leaving the holes\\r\\nunfilled, again set out for the hut, at which, for\\r\\nthe second time, we deposited our golden burthens,\\r\\njust as the first faint streaks of the dawn gleamed\\r\\nfrom over the tree-tops in the East.We were now thoroughly broken down;\\r\\nbut the intense excitement of the time denied us repose. \\r\\nAfter an unquiet slumber of some three or four hours’\\r\\nduration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination\\r\\nof our treasure.The chest had been full to the brim,\\r\\nand we spent the whole day, and the greater part of\\r\\nthe next night, in a scrutiny of its contents. \\r\\nThere had been nothing like order or arrangement. \\r\\nEvery thing had been heaped in promiscuously. \\r\\nHaving assorted all with care, we found ourselves\\r\\npossessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first\\r\\nsupposed.  In coin there was rather more than\\r\\nfour hundred and fifty thousand dollars ­estimating\\r\\nthe value of the pieces, as accurately as we could,\\r\\nby the tables of the period.  There was not a particle\\r\\nof silver.  All was gold of antique date and of\\r\\ngreat variety ­French, Spanish, and German\\r\\nmoney, with a few English guineas, and some counters,\\r\\nof which we had never seen specimens before. \\r\\nThere were several very large and heavy coins, so\\r\\nworn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions. \\r\\nThere was no American money.  The value of the\\r\\njewels we found more difficulty in estimating. \\r\\nThere were diamonds ­some of them exceedingly\\r\\nlarge and fine ­a hundred and ten in all,\\r\\nand not one of them small; eighteen rubies of remarkable\\r\\nbrilliancy; ­three hundred and ten emeralds,\\r\\nall very beautiful; and twenty-one sapphires, with\\r\\nan opal.  These stones had all been broken from\\r\\ntheir settings and thrown loose in the chest. \\r\\nThe settings themselves, which we picked out from\\r\\namong the other gold, appeared to have been beaten\\r\\nup with hammers, as if to prevent identification. \\r\\nBesides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid\\r\\ngold ornaments; ­nearly two hundred massive\\r\\nfinger and earrings; ­rich chains ­thirty\\r\\nof these, if I remember; ­eighty-three very\\r\\nlarge and heavy crucifixes; ­five gold censers\\r\\nof great value; ­a prodigious golden punch\\r\\nbowl, ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and\\r\\nBacchanalian figures; with two sword-handles exquisitely\\r\\nembossed, and many other smaller articles which I\\r\\ncannot recollect.  The weight of these valuables\\r\\nexceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois;\\r\\nand in this estimate I have not included one hundred\\r\\nand ninety-seven superb gold watches; three of the\\r\\nnumber being worth each five hundred dollars, if one. \\r\\nMany of them were very old, and as time keepers valueless;\\r\\nthe works having suffered, more or less, from corrosion ­but\\r\\nall were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth. \\r\\nWe estimated the entire contents of the chest, that\\r\\nnight, at a million and a half of dollars; and upon\\r\\nthe subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels\\r\\n(a few being retained for our own use), it was found\\r\\nthat we had greatly undervalued the treasure. \\r\\nWhen, at length, we had concluded our examination,\\r\\nand the intense excitement of the time had, in some\\r\\nmeasure, subsided, Legrand, who saw that I was dying\\r\\nwith impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary\\r\\nriddle, entered into a full detail of all the circumstances\\r\\nconnected with it.“You remember;” said he,\\r\\n“the night when I handed you the rough sketch\\r\\nI had made of the scarabÃ¦us.  You recollect also,\\r\\nthat I became quite vexed at you for insisting that\\r\\nmy drawing resembled a death’s-head.  When\\r\\nyou first made this assertion I thought you were jesting;\\r\\nbut afterwards I called to mind the peculiar spots\\r\\non the back of the insect, and admitted to myself\\r\\nthat your remark had some little foundation in fact. \\r\\nStill, the sneer at my graphic powers irritated me ­for\\r\\nI am considered a good artist ­and, therefore,\\r\\nwhen you handed me the scrap of parchment, I was about\\r\\nto crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire.”“The scrap of paper, you mean,” said I.“No; it had much of the appearance\\r\\nof paper, and at first I supposed it to be such, but\\r\\nwhen I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at once,\\r\\nto be a piece of very thin parchment.  It was quite\\r\\ndirty, you remember.  Well, as I was in the very\\r\\nact of crumpling it up, my glance fell upon the sketch\\r\\nat which you had been looking, and you may imagine\\r\\nmy astonishment when I perceived, in fact, the figure\\r\\nof a death’s-head just where, it seemed to me,\\r\\nI had made the drawing of the beetle.  For a moment\\r\\nI was too much amazed to think with accuracy. \\r\\nI knew that my design was very different in detail\\r\\nfrom this ­although there was a certain\\r\\nsimilarity in general outline.  Presently I took\\r\\na candle, and seating myself at the other end of the\\r\\nroom, proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely. \\r\\nUpon turning it over, I saw my own sketch upon the\\r\\nreverse, just as I had made it.  My first idea,\\r\\nnow, was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity\\r\\nof outline ­at the singular coincidence\\r\\ninvolved in the fact, that unknown to me, there should\\r\\nhave been a skull upon the other side of the parchment,\\r\\nimmediately beneath my figure of the scarabÃ¦us, and\\r\\nthat this skull, not only in outline, but in size,\\r\\nshould so closely resemble my drawing.  I say the\\r\\nsingularity of this coincidence absolutely stupified\\r\\nme for a time.  This is the usual effect of such\\r\\ncoincidences.  The mind struggles to establish\\r\\na connexion ­a sequence of cause and effect ­and,\\r\\nbeing unable to do so, suffers a species of temporary\\r\\nparalysis.  But, when I recovered from this stupor,\\r\\nthere dawned upon me gradually a conviction which\\r\\nstartled me even far more than the coincidence. \\r\\nI began distinctly, positively, to remember that there\\r\\nhad been no drawing upon the parchment when I made\\r\\nmy sketch of the scarabÃ¦us.  I became perfectly\\r\\ncertain of this; for I recollected turning up first\\r\\none side and then the other, in search of the cleanest\\r\\nspot.  Had the skull been then there, of course\\r\\nI could not have failed to notice it.  Here was\\r\\nindeed a mystery which I felt it impossible to explain;\\r\\nbut, even at that early moment, there seemed to glimmer,\\r\\nfaintly, within the most remote and secret chambers\\r\\nof my intellect, a glow-worm-like conception of that\\r\\ntruth which last night’s adventure brought to\\r\\nso magnificent a demonstration.  I arose at once,\\r\\nand putting the parchment securely away, dismissed\\r\\nall farther reflection until I should be alone.“When you had gone, and when\\r\\nJupiter was fast asleep, I betook myself to a more\\r\\nmethodical investigation of the affair.  In the\\r\\nfirst place I considered the manner in which the parchment\\r\\nhad come into my possession.  The spot where we\\r\\ndiscovered the scarabaeus was on the coast of the\\r\\nmain land, about a mile eastward of the island, and\\r\\nbut a short distance above high water mark.  Upon\\r\\nmy taking hold of it, it gave me a sharp bite, which\\r\\ncaused me to let it drop.  Jupiter, with his accustomed\\r\\ncaution, before seizing the insect, which had flown\\r\\ntowards him, looked about him for a leaf, or something\\r\\nof that nature, by which to take hold of it. \\r\\nIt was at this moment that his eyes, and mine also,\\r\\nfell upon the scrap of parchment, which I then supposed\\r\\nto be paper.  It was lying half buried in the\\r\\nsand, a corner sticking up.  Near the spot where\\r\\nwe found it, I observed the remnants of the hull of\\r\\nwhat appeared to have been a ship’s long boat. \\r\\nThe wreck seemed to have been there for a very great\\r\\nwhile; for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely\\r\\nbe traced.“Well, Jupiter picked up the\\r\\nparchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and gave it to\\r\\nme.  Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and\\r\\non the way met Lieutenant G-.  I showed him the\\r\\ninsect, and he begged me to let him take it to the\\r\\nfort.  Upon my consenting, he thrust it forthwith\\r\\ninto his waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in\\r\\nwhich it had been wrapped, and which I had continued\\r\\nto hold in my hand during his inspection.  Perhaps\\r\\nhe dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it best\\r\\nto make sure of the prize at once ­you know\\r\\nhow enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected with\\r\\nNatural History.  At the same time, without being\\r\\nconscious of it, I must have deposited the parchment\\r\\nin my own pocket.“You remember that when I went\\r\\nto the table, for the purpose of making a sketch of\\r\\nthe beetle, I found no paper where it was usually kept. \\r\\nI looked in the drawer, and found none there. \\r\\nI searched my pockets, hoping to find an old letter,\\r\\nwhen my hand fell upon the parchment.  I thus\\r\\ndetail the precise mode in which it came into my possession;\\r\\nfor the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force.“No doubt you will think me\\r\\nfanciful ­but I had already established a\\r\\nkind of connexion.  I had put together two links\\r\\nof a great chain.  There was a boat lying upon\\r\\na sea-coast, and not far from the boat was a parchment ­not\\r\\na paper ­with a skull depicted upon it. \\r\\nYou will, of course, ask ‘where is the connexion?’\\r\\nI reply that the skull, or death’s-head, is\\r\\nthe well-known emblem of the pirate.  The flag\\r\\nof the death’s head is hoisted in all engagements.“I have said that the scrap\\r\\nwas parchment, and not paper.  Parchment is durable ­almost\\r\\nimperishable.  Matters of little moment are rarely\\r\\nconsigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary\\r\\npurposes of drawing or writing, it is not nearly so\\r\\nwell adapted as paper.  This reflection suggested\\r\\nsome meaning ­some relevancy ­in\\r\\nthe death’s-head.  I did not fail to observe,\\r\\nalso, the form of the parchment.  Although one\\r\\nof its corners had been, by some accident, destroyed,\\r\\nit could be seen that the original form was oblong. \\r\\nIt was just such a slip, indeed, as might have been\\r\\nchosen for a memorandum ­for a record of\\r\\nsomething to be long remembered and carefully preserved.”“But,” I interposed, “you\\r\\nsay that the skull was not upon the parchment when\\r\\nyou made the drawing of the beetle.  How then do\\r\\nyou trace any connexion between the boat and the skull ­since\\r\\nthis latter, according to your own admission, must\\r\\nhave been designed (God only knows how or by whom)\\r\\nat some period subsequent to your sketching the scarabÃ¦us?”“Ah, hereupon turns the whole\\r\\nmystery; although the secret, at this point, I had\\r\\ncomparatively little difficulty in solving.  My\\r\\nsteps were sure, and could afford but a single result. \\r\\nI reasoned, for example, thus:  When I drew the\\r\\nscarabÃ¦us, there was no skull apparent upon the parchment. \\r\\nWhen I had completed the drawing I gave it to you,\\r\\nand observed you narrowly until you returned it. \\r\\nYou, therefore, did not design the skull, and no one\\r\\nelse was present to do it.  Then it was not done\\r\\nby human agency.  And nevertheless it was done.“At this stage of my reflections\\r\\nI endeavored to remember, and did remember, with entire\\r\\ndistinctness, every incident which occurred about\\r\\nthe period in question.  The weather was chilly\\r\\n(oh rare and happy accident!), and a fire was blazing\\r\\nupon the hearth.  I was heated with exercise and\\r\\nsat near the table.  You, however, had drawn a\\r\\nchair close to the chimney.  Just as I placed\\r\\nthe parchment in your hand, and as you were in the\\r\\nact of inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered,\\r\\nand leaped upon your shoulders.  With your left\\r\\nhand you caressed him and kept him off, while your\\r\\nright, holding the parchment, was permitted to fall\\r\\nlistlessly between your knees, and in close proximity\\r\\nto the fire.  At one moment I thought the blaze\\r\\nhad caught it, and was about to caution you, but,\\r\\nbefore I could speak, you had withdrawn it, and were\\r\\nengaged in its examination.  When I considered\\r\\nall these particulars, I doubted not for a moment\\r\\nthat heat had been the agent in bringing to light,\\r\\nupon the parchment, the skull which I saw designed\\r\\nupon it.  You are well aware that chemical preparations\\r\\nexist, and have existed time out of mind, by means\\r\\nof which it is possible to write upon either paper\\r\\nor vellum, so that the characters shall become visible\\r\\nonly when subjected to the action of fire.  Zaffre,\\r\\ndigested in aqua regia, and diluted with\\r\\nfour times its weight of water, is sometimes employed;\\r\\na green tint results.  The regulus of cobalt,\\r\\ndissolved in spirit of nitre, gives a red.  These\\r\\ncolors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after\\r\\nthe material written upon cools, but again become apparent\\r\\nupon the re-application of heat.“I now scrutinized the death’s-head\\r\\nwith care.  Its outer edges ­the edges\\r\\nof the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum ­were\\r\\nfar more distinct than the others.  It was clear\\r\\nthat the action of the caloric had been imperfect\\r\\nor unequal.  I immediately kindled a fire, and\\r\\nsubjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing\\r\\nheat.  At first, the only effect was the strengthening\\r\\nof the faint lines in the skull; but, upon persevering\\r\\nin the experiment, there became visible, at the corner\\r\\nof the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which\\r\\nthe death’s-head was delineated, the figure\\r\\nof what I at first supposed to be a goat.  A closer\\r\\nscrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was intended\\r\\nfor a kid.”“Ha! ha!” said I, “to\\r\\nbe sure I have no right to laugh at you ­a\\r\\nmillion and a half of money is too serious a matter\\r\\nfor mirth ­but you are not about to establish\\r\\na third link in your chain ­you will not\\r\\nfind any especial connexion between your pirates and\\r\\na goat ­pirates, you know, have nothing\\r\\nto do with goats; they appertain to the farming interest.”“But I have just said that the\\r\\nfigure was not that of a goat.”“Well, a kid then ­pretty much the\\r\\nsame thing.”“Pretty much, but not altogether,”\\r\\nsaid Legrand.  “You may have heard of one\\r\\nCaptain Kidd.  I at once looked upon the figure\\r\\nof the animal as a kind of punning or hieroglyphical\\r\\nsignature.  I say signature; because its position\\r\\nupon the vellum suggested this idea.  The death’s-head\\r\\nat the corner diagonally opposite, had, in the same\\r\\nmanner, the air of a stamp, or seal.  But I was\\r\\nsorely put out by the absence of all else ­of\\r\\nthe body to my imagined instrument ­of the\\r\\ntext for my context.”“I presume you expected to find\\r\\na letter between the stamp and the signature.”“Something of that kind. \\r\\nThe fact is, I felt irresistibly impressed with a\\r\\npresentiment of some vast good fortune impending. \\r\\nI can scarcely say why.  Perhaps, after all, it\\r\\nwas rather a desire than an actual belief; ­but\\r\\ndo you know that Jupiter’s silly words, about\\r\\nthe bug being of solid gold, had a remarkable effect\\r\\nupon my fancy?  And then the series of accidents\\r\\nand coincidences ­these were so very extraordinary. \\r\\nDo you observe how mere an accident it was that these\\r\\nevents should have occurred upon the sole day of all\\r\\nthe year in which it has been, or may be, sufficiently\\r\\ncool for fire, and that without the fire, or without\\r\\nthe intervention of the dog at the precise moment in\\r\\nwhich he appeared, I should never have become aware\\r\\nof the death’s-head, and so never the possessor\\r\\nof the treasure?”“But proceed ­I am all impatience.”“Well; you have heard, of course,\\r\\nthe many stories current ­the thousand vague\\r\\nrumors afloat about money buried, somewhere upon the\\r\\nAtlantic coast, by Kidd and his associates.  These\\r\\nrumors must have had some foundation in fact. \\r\\nAnd that the rumors have existed so long and so continuous,\\r\\ncould have resulted, it appeared to me, only from the\\r\\ncircumstance of the buried treasure still remaining\\r\\nentombed.  Had Kidd concealed his plunder for\\r\\na time, and afterwards reclaimed it, the rumors would\\r\\nscarcely have reached us in their present unvarying\\r\\nform.  You will observe that the stories told\\r\\nare all about money-seekers, not about money-finders. \\r\\nHad the pirate recovered his money, there the affair\\r\\nwould have dropped.  It seemed to me that some\\r\\naccident ­say the loss of a memorandum indicating\\r\\nits locality ­had deprived him of the means\\r\\nof recovering it, and that this accident had become\\r\\nknown to his followers, who otherwise might never\\r\\nhave heard that treasure had been concealed at all,\\r\\nand who, busying themselves in vain, because unguided\\r\\nattempts, to regain it, had given first birth, and\\r\\nthen universal currency, to the reports which are\\r\\nnow so common.  Have you ever heard of any important\\r\\ntreasure being unearthed along the coast?”“Never.”“But that Kidd’s accumulations\\r\\nwere immense, is well known.  I took it for granted,\\r\\ntherefore, that the earth still held them; and you\\r\\nwill scarcely be surprised when I tell you that I\\r\\nfelt a hope, nearly amounting to certainty, that the\\r\\nparchment so strangely found, involved a lost record\\r\\nof the place of deposit.”“But how did you proceed?”“I held the vellum again to\\r\\nthe fire, after increasing the heat; but nothing appeared. \\r\\nI now thought it possible that the coating of dirt\\r\\nmight have something to do with the failure; so I carefully\\r\\nrinsed the parchment by pouring warm water over it,\\r\\nand, having done this, I placed it in a tin pan, with\\r\\nthe skull downwards, and put the pan upon a furnace\\r\\nof lighted charcoal.  In a few minutes, the pan\\r\\nhaving become thoroughly heated, I removed the slip,\\r\\nand, to my inexpressible joy, found it spotted, in\\r\\nseveral places, with what appeared to be figures arranged\\r\\nin lines.  Again I placed it in the pan, and suffered\\r\\nit to remain another minute.  Upon taking it off,\\r\\nthe whole was just as you see it now.” \\r\\nHere Legrand, having re-heated the parchment, submitted\\r\\nit to my inspection.  The following characters\\r\\nwere rudely traced, in a red tint, between the death’s-head\\r\\nand the goat: “But,” said I, returning\\r\\nhim the slip, “I am as much in the dark as ever. \\r\\nWere all the jewels of Golconda awaiting me upon my\\r\\nsolution of this enigma, I am quite sure that I should\\r\\nbe unable to earn them.”“And yet,” said Legrand,\\r\\n“the solution is by no means so difficult as\\r\\nyou might be lead to imagine from the first hasty inspection\\r\\nof the characters.  These characters, as any one\\r\\nmight readily guess, form a cipher ­that\\r\\nis to say, they convey a meaning; but then, from what\\r\\nis known of Kidd, I could not suppose him capable\\r\\nof constructing any of the more abstruse cryptographs. \\r\\nI made up my mind, at once, that this was of a simple\\r\\nspecies ­such, however, as would appear,\\r\\nto the crude intellect of the sailor, absolutely insoluble\\r\\nwithout the key.”“And you really solved it?”“Readily; I have solved others\\r\\nof an abstruseness ten thousand times greater. \\r\\nCircumstances, and a certain bias of mind, have led\\r\\nme to take interest in such riddles, and it may well\\r\\nbe doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an\\r\\nenigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not,\\r\\nby proper application, resolve.  In fact, having\\r\\nonce established connected and legible characters,\\r\\nI scarcely gave a thought to the mere difficulty of\\r\\ndeveloping their import.“In the present case ­indeed\\r\\nin all cases of secret writing ­the first\\r\\nquestion regards the language of the cipher; for the\\r\\nprinciples of solution, so far, especially, as the\\r\\nmore simple ciphers are concerned, depend upon, and\\r\\nare varied by, the genius of the particular idiom. \\r\\nIn general, there is no alternative but experiment\\r\\n(directed by probabilities) of every tongue known\\r\\nto him who attempts the solution, until the true one\\r\\nbe attained.  But, with the cipher now before us,\\r\\nall difficulty was removed by the signature. \\r\\nThe pun upon the word ‘Kidd’ is appreciable\\r\\nin no other language than the English.  But for\\r\\nthis consideration I should have begun my attempts\\r\\nwith the Spanish and French, as the tongues in which\\r\\na secret of this kind would most naturally have been\\r\\nwritten by a pirate of the Spanish main.  As it\\r\\nwas, I assumed the cryptograph to be English.“You observe there are no divisions\\r\\nbetween the words.  Had there been divisions,\\r\\nthe task would have been comparatively easy.  In\\r\\nsuch case I should have commenced with a collation\\r\\nand analysis of the shorter words, and, had a word\\r\\nof a single letter occurred, as is most likely, (a\\r\\nor I, for example,) I should have considered the solution\\r\\nas assured.  But, there being no division, my\\r\\nfirst step was to ascertain the predominant letters,\\r\\nas well as the least frequent.  Counting all, I\\r\\nconstructed a table, thus: Of the character 8 there are 33.; \" 26.4 \" 19.\\u0087 ) \" 16. \" 13.5 \" 12.6 \" 11.\\u0086 1 \" 8.0 \" 6.9 2 \" 5.:  3 \" 4.? \" 3.¶ \" 2.“Now, in English, the letter\\r\\nwhich most frequently occurs is e.  Afterwards,\\r\\nsuccession runs thus:  a o i d h n r s t u y\\r\\nc f g l m w b k p q x z. E predominates\\r\\nso remarkably that an individual sentence of any length\\r\\nis rarely seen, in which it is not the prevailing character.“Here, then, we leave, in the\\r\\nvery beginning, the groundwork for something more\\r\\nthan a mere guess.  The general use which may be\\r\\nmade of the table is obvious ­but, in this\\r\\nparticular cipher, we shall only very partially require\\r\\nits aid.  As our predominant character is 8, we\\r\\nwill commence by assuming it as the e of the\\r\\nnatural alphabet.  To verify the supposition,\\r\\nlet us observe if the 8 be seen often in couples ­for\\r\\ne is doubled with great frequency in English ­in\\r\\nsuch words, for example, as ‘meet,’ ‘.fleet,’\\r\\n‘speed,’ ‘seen,’ been,’\\r\\n‘agree,’ &amp;c.  In the present instance\\r\\nwe see it doubled no less than five times, although\\r\\nthe cryptograph is brief.“Let us assume 8, then, as e. \\r\\nNow, of all words in the language, ‘the’\\r\\nis most usual; let us see, therefore, whether there\\r\\nare not repetitions of any three characters, in the\\r\\nsame order of collocation, the last of them being\\r\\n8.  If we discover repetitions of such letters,\\r\\nso arranged, they will most probably represent the\\r\\nword ‘the.’  Upon inspection, we find\\r\\nno less than seven such arrangements, the characters\\r\\nbeing;48.  We may, therefore, assume that; represents\\r\\nt, 4 represents h, and 8 represents\\r\\ne ­the last being now well confirmed. \\r\\nThus a great step has been taken.“But, having established a single\\r\\nword, we are enabled to establish a vastly important\\r\\npoint; that is to say, several commencements and terminations\\r\\nof other words.  Let us refer, for example, to\\r\\nthe last instance but one, in which the combination;48\\r\\noccurs ­not far from the end of the cipher. \\r\\nWe know that the; immediately ensuing is the commencement\\r\\nof a word, and, of the six characters succeeding this\\r\\n‘the,’ we are cognizant of no less than\\r\\nfive.  Let us set these characters down, thus,\\r\\nby the letters we know them to represent, leaving\\r\\na space for the unknown ­t eeth.“Here we are enabled, at once,\\r\\nto discard the ‘th,’ as forming no portion\\r\\nof the word commencing with the first t; since, by\\r\\nexperiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted\\r\\nto the vacancy, we perceive that no word can be formed\\r\\nof which this th can be a part.  We are\\r\\nthus narrowed intot ee,and, going through the alphabet, if\\r\\nnecessary, as before, we arrive at the word ‘tree,’\\r\\nas the sole possible reading.  We thus gain another\\r\\nletter, r, represented by (, with the words\\r\\n‘the tree’ in juxtaposition.“Looking beyond these words,\\r\\nfor a short distance, we again see the combination;48,\\r\\nand employ it by way of termination to what\\r\\nimmediately precedes.  We have thus this arrangement: the tree;4(Â\\u0087?34 the,or, substituting the natural letters,\\r\\nwhere known, it reads thus: the tree thrÂ\\u0087?3h the.“Now, if, in place of the unknown\\r\\ncharacters, we leave blank spaces, or substitute dots,\\r\\nwe read thus: the tree thr...h the,when the word ‘through’\\r\\nmakes itself evident at once.  But this discovery\\r\\ngives us three new letters, o, u and\\r\\ng, represented by Â\\u0087? and 3.“Looking now, narrowly, through\\r\\nthe cipher for combinations of known characters, we\\r\\nfind, not very far from the beginning, this arrangement,83(88, or egree,which, plainly, is the conclusion\\r\\nof the word ‘degree,’ and gives us another\\r\\nletter, d, represented by Â\\u0086.“Four letters beyond the word\\r\\n‘degree,’ we perceive the combination;46(;88.“Translating the known characters,\\r\\nand representing the unknown by dots, as before, we\\r\\nread thus:  th rtee. an arrangement immediately\\r\\nsuggestive of the word ‘thirteen,’ and\\r\\nagain furnishing us with two new characters, i\\r\\nand n, represented by 6 and .“Referring, now, to the beginning\\r\\nof the cryptograph, we find the combination,53Â\\u0087Â\\u0087Â\\u0086.“Translating, as before, we obtaingood,which assures us that the first letter\\r\\nis A, and that the first two words are ‘A\\r\\ngood.’“It is now time that we arrange\\r\\nour key, as far as discovered, in a tabular form,\\r\\nto avoid confusion.  It will stand thus: 5 represents      aÂ\\u0086       \"        \\r\\nd8       \"         e3       \"         g4       \"         h6       \"         i       \"         nÂ\\u0087       \"        \\r\\no(        \"        \\r\\nr;        \"         t“We have, therefore, no less\\r\\nthan ten of the most important letters represented,\\r\\nand it will be unnecessary to proceed with the details\\r\\nof the solution.  I have said enough to convince\\r\\nyou that ciphers of this nature are readily soluble,\\r\\nand to give you some insight into the rationale of\\r\\ntheir development.  But be assured that the specimen\\r\\nbefore us appertains to the very simplest species\\r\\nof cryptograph.  It now only remains to give you\\r\\nthe full translation of the characters upon the parchment,\\r\\nas unriddled.  Here it is: “’A good glass in the\\r\\nbishop’s hostel in the devil’s seat forty-one\\r\\ndegrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north\\r\\nmain branch seventh limb east side shoot from the\\r\\nleft eye of the death’s-head a bee line from\\r\\nthe tree through the shot fifty feet out.’”“But,” said I, “the\\r\\nenigma seems still in as bad a condition as ever. \\r\\nHow is it possible to extort a meaning from all this\\r\\njargon about ‘devil’s seats,’ ‘death’s\\r\\nheads,’ and ‘bishop’s hotels?’”“I confess,” replied Legrand,\\r\\n“that the matter still wears a serious aspect,\\r\\nwhen regarded with a casual glance.  My first endeavor\\r\\nwas to divide the sentence into the natural division\\r\\nintended by the cryptographist.”“You mean, to punctuate it?”“Something of that kind.”“But how was it possible to effect this?”“I reflected that it had been\\r\\na point with the writer to run his words together\\r\\nwithout division, so as to increase the difficulty\\r\\nof solution.  Now, a not over-acute man, in pursuing\\r\\nsuch an object would be nearly certain to overdo the\\r\\nmatter.  When, in the course of his composition,\\r\\nhe arrived at a break in his subject which would naturally\\r\\nrequire a pause, or a point, he would be exceedingly\\r\\napt to run his characters, at this place, more than\\r\\nusually close together.  If you will observe the\\r\\nMS., in the present instance, you will easily detect\\r\\nfive such cases of unusual crowding.  Acting upon\\r\\nthis hint, I made the division thus:  ’A\\r\\ngood glass in the Bishop’s hostel in the Devil’s\\r\\nseat ­forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes ­northeast\\r\\nand by north ­main branch seventh limb east\\r\\nside ­shoot from the left eye of the death’s-head ­a\\r\\nbee-line from the tree through the shot fifty feet\\r\\nout.’”“Even this division,” said I, “leaves\\r\\nme still in the dark.”“It left me also in the dark,”\\r\\nreplied Legrand, “for a few days; during which\\r\\nI made diligent inquiry, in the neighborhood of Sullivan’s\\r\\nIsland, for any building which went by the name of\\r\\nthe ‘Bishop’s Hotel;’ for, of course,\\r\\nI dropped the obsolete word ‘hostel.’ \\r\\nGaining no information on the subject, I was on the\\r\\npoint of extending my sphere of search, and proceeding\\r\\nin a more systematic manner, when, one morning, it\\r\\nentered into my head, quite suddenly, that this ‘Bishop’s\\r\\nHostel’ might have some reference to an old\\r\\nfamily, of the name of Bessop, which, time out of\\r\\nmind, had held possession of an ancient manor-house,\\r\\nabout four miles to the northward of the Island. \\r\\nI accordingly went over to the plantation, and re-instituted\\r\\nmy inquiries among the older negroes of the place. \\r\\nAt length one of the most aged of the women said that\\r\\nshe had heard of such a place as Bessop’s Castle,\\r\\nand thought that she could guide me to it, but that\\r\\nit was not a castle nor a tavern, but a high rock.“I offered to pay her well for\\r\\nher trouble, and, after some demur, she consented\\r\\nto accompany me to the spot.  We found it without\\r\\nmuch difficulty, when, dismissing her, I proceeded\\r\\nto examine the place.  The ‘castle’\\r\\nconsisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and\\r\\nrocks ­one of the latter being quite remarkable\\r\\nfor its height as well as for its insulated and artificial\\r\\nappearance I clambered to its apex, and then felt\\r\\nmuch at a loss as to what should be next done.“While I was busied in reflection,\\r\\nmy eyes fell upon a narrow ledge in the eastern face\\r\\nof the rock, perhaps a yard below the summit upon which\\r\\nI stood.  This ledge projected about eighteen inches,\\r\\nand was not more than a foot wide, while a niche in\\r\\nthe cliff just above it, gave it a rude resemblance\\r\\nto one of the hollow-backed chairs used by our ancestors. \\r\\nI made no doubt that here was the ‘devil’s\\r\\nseat’ alluded to in the MS., and now I seemed\\r\\nto grasp the full secret of the riddle.“The ‘good glass,’\\r\\nI knew, could have reference to nothing but a telescope;\\r\\nfor the word ‘glass’ is rarely employed\\r\\nin any other sense by seamen.  Now here, I at\\r\\nonce saw, was a telescope to be used, and a definite\\r\\npoint of view, admitting no variation, from which to\\r\\nuse it.  Nor did I hesitate to believe that the\\r\\nphrases, “forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes,’\\r\\nand ‘northeast and by north,’ were intended\\r\\nas directions for the levelling of the glass. \\r\\nGreatly excited by these discoveries, I hurried home,\\r\\nprocured a telescope, and returned to the rock.“I let myself down to the ledge,\\r\\nand found that it was impossible to retain a seat\\r\\nupon it except in one particular position.  This\\r\\nfact confirmed my preconceived idea.  I proceeded\\r\\nto use the glass.  Of course, the ‘forty-one\\r\\ndegrees and thirteen minutes’ could allude to\\r\\nnothing but elevation above the visible horizon, since\\r\\nthe horizontal direction was clearly indicated by\\r\\nthe words, ‘northeast and by north.’ \\r\\nThis latter direction I at once established by means\\r\\nof a pocket-compass; then, pointing the glass as nearly\\r\\nat an angle of forty-one degrees of elevation as I\\r\\ncould do it by guess, I moved it cautiously up or down,\\r\\nuntil my attention was arrested by a circular rift\\r\\nor opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtopped\\r\\nits fellows in the distance.  In the centre of\\r\\nthis rift I perceived a white spot, but could not,\\r\\nat first, distinguish what it was.  Adjusting\\r\\nthe focus of the telescope, I again looked, and now\\r\\nmade it out to be a human skull.“Upon this discovery I was so\\r\\nsanguine as to consider the enigma solved; for the\\r\\nphrase ‘main branch, seventh limb, east side,’\\r\\ncould refer only to the position of the skull upon\\r\\nthe tree, while ’shoot from the left eye of\\r\\nthe death’s head’ admitted, also, of but\\r\\none interpretation, in regard to a search for buried\\r\\ntreasure.  I perceived that the design was to\\r\\ndrop a bullet from the left eye of the skull, and that\\r\\na bee-line, or, in other words, a straight line, drawn\\r\\nfrom the nearest point of the trunk through ‘the\\r\\nshot,’ (or the spot where the bullet fell,) and\\r\\nthence extended to a distance of fifty feet, would\\r\\nindicate a definite point ­and beneath this\\r\\npoint I thought it at least possible that a deposit\\r\\nof value lay concealed.”“All this,” I said, “is\\r\\nexceedingly clear, and, although ingenious, still\\r\\nsimple and explicit.  When you left the Bishop’s\\r\\nHotel, what then?”“Why, having carefully taken\\r\\nthe bearings of the tree, I turned homewards. \\r\\nThe instant that I left ‘the devil’s seat,’\\r\\nhowever, the circular rift vanished; nor could I get\\r\\na glimpse of it afterwards, turn as I would. \\r\\nWhat seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole\\r\\nbusiness, is the fact (for repeated experiment has\\r\\nconvinced me it is a fact) that the circular opening\\r\\nin question is visible from no other attainable point\\r\\nof view than that afforded by the narrow ledge upon\\r\\nthe face of the rock.“In this expedition to the ‘Bishop’s\\r\\nHotel’ I had been attended by Jupiter, who had,\\r\\nno doubt, observed, for some weeks past, the abstraction\\r\\nof my demeanor, and took especial care not to leave\\r\\nme alone.  But, on the next day, getting up very\\r\\nearly, I contrived to give him the slip, and went\\r\\ninto the hills in search of the tree.  After much\\r\\ntoil I found it.  When I came home at night my\\r\\nvalet proposed to give me a flogging.  With the\\r\\nrest of the adventure I believe you are as well acquainted\\r\\nas myself.”“I suppose,” said I, “you\\r\\nmissed the spot, in the first attempt at digging,\\r\\nthrough Jupiter’s stupidity in letting the bug\\r\\nfall through the right instead of through the left\\r\\neye of the skull.”“Precisely.  This mistake\\r\\nmade a difference of about two inches and a half in\\r\\nthe ’shot’ ­that is to say, in\\r\\nthe position of the peg nearest the tree; and had\\r\\nthe treasure been beneath the ‘shot,’ the\\r\\nerror would have been of little moment; but ‘the\\r\\nshot,’ together with the nearest point of the\\r\\ntree, were merely two points for the establishment\\r\\nof a line of direction; of course the error, however\\r\\ntrivial in the beginning, increased as we proceeded\\r\\nwith the line, and by the time we had gone fifty feet,\\r\\nthrew us quite off the scent.  But for my deep-seated\\r\\nimpressions that treasure was here somewhere actually\\r\\nburied, we might have had all our labor in vain.”“But your grandiloquence, and\\r\\nyour conduct in swinging the beetle ­how\\r\\nexcessively odd!  I was sure you were mad. \\r\\nAnd why did you insist upon letting fall the bug,\\r\\ninstead of a bullet, from the skull?”“Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat\\r\\nannoyed by your evident suspicions touching my sanity,\\r\\nand so resolved to punish you quietly, in my own way,\\r\\nby a little bit of sober mystification.  For this\\r\\nreason I swung the beetle, and for this reason I let\\r\\nit fall it from the tree.  An observation of yours\\r\\nabout its great weight suggested the latter idea.”“Yes, I perceive; and now there\\r\\nis only one point which puzzles me.  What are\\r\\nwe to make of the skeletons found in the hole?”“That is a question I am no\\r\\nmore able to answer than yourself.  There seems,\\r\\nhowever, only one plausible way of accounting for them ­and\\r\\nyet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as\\r\\nmy suggestion would imply.  It is clear that Kidd ­if\\r\\nKidd indeed secreted this treasure, which I doubt\\r\\nnot ­it is clear that he must have had assistance\\r\\nin the labor.  But this labor concluded, he may\\r\\nhave thought it expedient to remove all participants\\r\\nin his secret.  Perhaps a couple of blows with\\r\\na mattock were sufficient, while his coadjutors were\\r\\nbusy in the pit; perhaps it required a dozen ­who\\r\\nshall tell?”'</span>"

       "'          What\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nho! what ho! this fellow is dancing mad!He hath been bitten\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nby the Tarantula.\\_ ­All\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin the Wrong.\\_MANY years ago, I contracted an intimacy\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith a Mr. William Legrand.  He was of an ancient\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHuguenot family, and had once been wealthy; but a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nseries of misfortunes had reduced him to want. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nTo avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe left New Orleans, the city of his forefathers,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand took up his residence at Sullivan’s Island,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnear Charleston, South Carolina.  This Island is\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na very singular one.  It consists of little else\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthan the sea sand, and is about three miles long. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIts breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIt is separated from the main land by a scarcely perceptible\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncreek, oozing its way through a wilderness of reeds\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand slime, a favorite resort of the marsh hen. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe vegetation, as might be supposed, is scant, or\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nat least dwarfish.  No trees of any magnitude\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nare to be seen.  Near the western extremity, where\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nFort Moultrie stands, and where are some miserable\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nframe buildings, tenanted, during summer, by the fugitives\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom Charleston dust and fever, may be found, indeed,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe bristly palmetto; but the whole island, with the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nexception of this western point, and a line of hard,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhite beach on the seacoast, is covered with a dense\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nundergrowth of the sweet myrtle, so much prized by\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe horticulturists of England.  The shrub here\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}noften attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand forms an almost impenetrable coppice, burthening\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe air with its fragrance.In the inmost recesses of this coppice,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnot far from the eastern or more remote end of the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nisland, Legrand had built himself a small hut, which\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe occupied when I first, by mere accident, made his\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nacquaintance.  This soon ripened into friendship ­for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthere was much in the recluse to excite interest and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nesteem.  I found him well educated, with unusual\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npowers of mind, but infected with misanthropy, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsubject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand melancholy.  He had with him many books, but\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nrarely employed them.  His chief amusements were\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ngunning and fishing, or sauntering along the beach\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand through the myrtles, in quest of shells or entomological\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nspecimens; ­his collection of the latter\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmight have been envied by a Swammerdamm.  In these\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nexcursions he was usually accompanied by an old negro,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncalled Jupiter, who had been manumitted before the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nreverses of the family, but who could be induced,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nneither by threats nor by promises, to abandon what\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof his young “Massa Will.”  It is\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnot improbable that the relatives of Legrand, conceiving\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhim to be somewhat unsettled in intellect, had contrived\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto instil this obstinacy into Jupiter, with a view\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer.The winters in the latitude of Sullivan’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIsland are seldom very severe, and in the fall of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconsidered necessary.  About the middle of October,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n18-, there occurred, however, a day of remarkable\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nchilliness.  Just before sunset I scrambled my\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nway through the evergreens to the hut of my friend,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhom I had not visited for several weeks ­my\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nresidence being, at that time, in Charleston, a distance\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof nine miles from the Island, while the facilities\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof passage and re-passage were very far behind those\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the present day.  Upon reaching the hut I rapped,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nas was my custom, and getting no reply, sought for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe key where I knew it was secreted, unlocked the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndoor and went in.  A fine fire was blazing upon\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe hearth.  It was a novelty, and by no means\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nan ungrateful one.  I threw off an overcoat, took\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nan arm-chair by the crackling logs, and awaited patiently\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe arrival of my hosts.Soon after dark they arrived, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ngave me a most cordial welcome.  Jupiter, grinning\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom ear to ear, bustled about to prepare some marsh-hens\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor supper.  Legrand was in one of his fits ­how\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nelse shall I term them? ­of enthusiasm. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHe had found an unknown bivalve, forming a new genus,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand, more than this, he had hunted down and secured,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith Jupiter’s assistance, a scarabÃ¦us which\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe believed to be totally new, but in respect to which\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe wished to have my opinion on the morrow.“And why not to-night?”\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI asked, rubbing my hands over the blaze, and wishing\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe whole tribe of scarabÃ¦i at the devil.“Ah, if I had only known you\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwere here!” said Legrand, “but it’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nso long since I saw you; and how could I foresee that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyou would pay me a visit this very night of all others? \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAs I was coming home I met Lieutenant G ­,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom the fort, and, very foolishly, I lent him the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbug; so it will be impossible for you to see it until\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe morning.  Stay here to-night, and I will send\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nJup down for it at sunrise.  It is the loveliest\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthing in creation!”“What? ­sunrise?”“Nonsense! no! ­the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbug.  It is of a brilliant gold color ­about\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe size of a large hickory-nut ­with two\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}njet black spots near one extremity of the back, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nanother, somewhat longer, at the other.  The antennÃ¦\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nare ­”“Dey aint no tin in him, Massa\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWill, I keep a tellin on you,” here interrupted\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nJupiter; “de bug is a goole bug, solid, ebery\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbit of him, inside and all, sep him wing ­neber\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfeel half so hebby a bug in my life.”“Well, suppose it is, Jup,”\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nreplied Legrand, somewhat more earnestly, it seemed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto me, than the case demanded, “is that any reason\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor your letting the birds burn?  The color” ­here\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe turned to me ­“is really almost\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nenough to warrant Jupiter’s idea.  You never\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsaw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nemit ­but of this you cannot judge till\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntomorrow.  In the mean time I can give you some\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nidea of the shape.”  Saying this, he seated\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhimself at a small table, on which were a pen and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nink, but no paper.  He looked for some in a drawer,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbut found none.“Never mind,” said he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nat length, “this will answer;” and he drew\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbe very dirty foolscap, and made upon it a rough drawing\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith the pen.  While he did this, I retained my\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nseat by the fire, for I was still chilly.  When\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe design was complete, he handed it to me without\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nrising.  As I received it, a loud growl was heard,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsucceeded by a scratching at the door.  Jupiter\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nopened it, and a large Newfoundland, belonging to Legrand,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nrushed in, leaped upon my shoulders, and loaded me\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith caresses; for I had shown him much attention\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nduring previous visits.  When his gambols were\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nover, I looked at the paper, and, to speak the truth,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfound myself not a little puzzled at what my friend\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhad depicted.“Well!” I said, after\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncontemplating it for some minutes, “this is a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nstrange scarabÃ¦us, I must confess:  new to me: \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnever saw anything like it before ­unless\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit was a skull, or a death’s-head ­which\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit more nearly resembles than anything else that has\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncome under my observation.”“A death’s-head!”\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nechoed Legrand ­“Oh ­yes ­well,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit has something of that appearance upon paper, no\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndoubt.  The two upper black spots look like eyes,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}neh? and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth ­and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthen the shape of the whole is oval.”“Perhaps so,” said I;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n“but, Legrand, I fear you are no artist. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI must wait until I see the beetle itself, if I am\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto form any idea of its personal appearance.”“Well, I don’t know,”\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsaid he, a little nettled, “I draw tolerably ­should\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndo it at least ­have had good masters, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nflatter myself that I am not quite a blockhead.”“But, my dear fellow, you are\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}njoking then,” said I, “this is a very\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npassable skull ­indeed, I may say that it\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nis a very excellent skull, according to the vulgar\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnotions about such specimens of physiology ­and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyour scarabÃ¦us must be the queerest scarabÃ¦us in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe world if it resembles it.  Why, we may get\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nup a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhint.  I presume you will call the bug scarabÃ¦us\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncaput hominis, or something of that kind ­there\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nare many similar titles in the Natural Histories. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBut where are the antennÃ¦ you spoke of?”“The antennÃ¦!” said Legrand,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwho seemed to be getting unaccountably warm upon the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsubject; “I am sure you must see the antennÃ¦. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI made them as distinct as they are in the original\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninsect, and I presume that is sufficient.”“Well, well,” I said,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n“perhaps you have ­still I don’t\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsee them;” and I handed him the paper without\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nadditional remark, not wishing to ruffle his temper;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbut I was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhis ill humor puzzled me ­and, as for the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndrawing of the beetle, there were positively no antennÃ¦\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nvisible, and the whole did bear a very close resemblance\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto the ordinary cuts of a death’s-head.He received the paper very peevishly,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand was about to crumple it, apparently to throw it\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin the fire, when a casual glance at the design seemed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsuddenly to rivet his attention.  In an instant\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhis face grew violently red ­in another\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nas excessively pale.  For some minutes he continued\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAt length he arose, took a candle from the table,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand proceeded to seat himself upon a sea-chest in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe farthest corner of the room.  Here again he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmade an anxious examination of the paper; turning\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit in all directions.  He said nothing, however,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand his conduct greatly astonished me; yet I thought\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof his temper by any comment.  Presently he took\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom his coat pocket a wallet, placed the paper carefully\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin it, and deposited both in a writing-desk, which\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe locked.  He now grew more composed in his demeanor;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbut his original air of enthusiasm had quite disappeared. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nYet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAs the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin reverie, from which no sallies of mine could arouse\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhim.  It had been my intention to pass the night\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nat the hut, as I had frequently done before, but,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nseeing my host in this mood, I deemed it proper to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntake leave.  He did not press me to remain, but,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nas I departed, he shook my hand with even more than\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhis usual cordiality.It was about a month after this (and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nduring the interval I had seen nothing of Legrand)\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhen I received a visit, at Charleston, from his man,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nJupiter.  I had never seen the good old negro look\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nso dispirited, and I feared that some serious disaster\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhad befallen my friend.“Well, Jup,” said I, “what\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nis the matter now? ­how is your master?”“Why, to speak de troof, massa,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhim not so berry well as mought be.”“Not well!  I am truly sorry\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto hear it.  What does he complain of?”“Dar! dat’s it! ­him\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nneber plain of notin ­but him berry sick\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor all dat.”“Very sick, Jupiter! ­why\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndidn’t you say so at once?  Is he confined\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto bed?”“No, dat he aint! ­he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}naint find nowhar ­dat’s just whar de\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nshoe pinch ­my mind is got to be berry hebby\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbout poor Massa Will.”“Jupiter, I should like to understand\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhat it is you are talking about.  You say your\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmaster is sick.  Hasn’t he told you what\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nails him?”“Why, massa, taint worf while\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor to git mad about de matter ­Massa Will\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsay noffin at all aint de matter wid him ­but\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nden what make him go about looking dis here\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nway, wid he head down and he soldiers up, and as white\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nas a gose?  And den he keep a syphon all de time ­”“Keeps a what, Jupiter?”“Keeps a syphon wid de figgurs\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}non de slate ­de queerest figgurs I ebber\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndid see.  Ise gittin to be skeered, I tell you. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHab for to keep mighty tight eye pon him noovers. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nTodder day he gib me slip fore de sun up and was gone\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nde whole ob de blessed day.  I had a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbig stick ready cut for to gib him deuced good beating\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhen he did come ­but Ise sich a fool\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndat I hadn’t de heart arter all ­he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlook so berry poorly.”“Eh? ­what? ­ah\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyes! ­upon the whole I think you had better\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnot be too severe with the poor fellow ­don’t\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nflog him, Jupiter ­he can’t very well\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nstand it ­but can you form no idea of what\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhas occasioned this illness, or rather this change\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof conduct?  Has anything unpleasant happened since\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI saw you?”“No, massa, dey aint bin noffin\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nunpleasant since den ­’twas fore den\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI’m feared ­’twas de berry day\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyou was dare.”“How? what do you mean?”“Why, massa, I mean de bug ­dare now.”“The what?”“De bug, ­I’m\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nberry sartain dat Massa Will bin bit somewhere bout\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nde head by dat goole-bug.”“And what cause have you, Jupiter, for such\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na supposition?”“Claws enuff, massa, and mouth\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntoo.  I nebber did see sick a deuced bug ­he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nkick and he bite ebery ting what cum near him. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMassa Will cotch him fuss, but had for to let him\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ngo gin mighty quick, I tell you ­den was\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nde time he must ha got de bite.  I did n’t\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlike de look oh de bug mouff, myself, no how, so I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwould n’t take hold ob him wid my finger,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbut I cotch him wid a piece ob paper dat I found. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI rap him up in de paper and stuff piece ob it\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin he mouff ­dat was de way.”“And you think, then, that your\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmaster was really bitten by the beetle, and that the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbite made him sick?”“I do n’t tink noffin\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nabout it ­I nose it.  What make him dream\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbout de goole so much, if taint cause he bit by de\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ngoole-bug?  Ise heerd bout dem goole-bugs\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfore dis.”“But how do you know he dreams about gold?”“How I know? why cause he talk about it in he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsleep ­dat’s how I nose.”“Well, Jup, perhaps you are\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nright; but to what fortunate circumstance am I to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nattribute the honor of a visit from you to-day?”“What de matter, massa?”“Did you bring any message from Mr. Legrand?”“No, massa, I bring dis\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhere pissel;” and here Jupiter handed me\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na note which ran thus:     MY DEAR   ­Why have I not seen you for so long\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na time?  I hope you have not been so foolish as\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto take offence at any little brusquerie of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmine; but no, that is improbable.  Since I saw\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyou I have had great cause for anxiety.  I have\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsomething to tell you, yet scarcely know how to tell\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit, or whether I should tell it at all.I have not been quite well for some\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndays past, and poor old Jup annoys me, almost beyond\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nendurance, by his well-meant attentions Would you\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbelieve it? ­he had prepared a huge stick,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe other day, with which to chastise me for giving\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhim the slip, and spending the day, solus,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}namong the hills on the main land.  I verily believe\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthat my ill looks alone saved me a flogging.I have made no addition to my cabinet since we met.If you can, in any way, make it convenient,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncome over with Jupiter. Do come.  I wish\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto see you to-night, upon business of importance. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI assure you that it is of the highest importance.        Ever\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyours,                     WILLIAM LEGRAND.There was something in the tone of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthis note which gave me great uneasiness.  Its\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhole style differed materially from that of Legrand. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWhat could he be dreaming of?  What new crotchet\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npossessed his excitable brain?  What “business\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the highest importance” could he possibly\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhave to transact?  Jupiter’s account of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhim boded no good.  I dreaded lest the continued\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npressure of misfortune had, at length, fairly unsettled\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe reason of my friend.  Without a moment’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhesitation, therefore, I prepared to accompany the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnegro.Upon reaching the wharf, I noticed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na scythe and three spades, all apparently new, lying\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin the bottom of the boat in which we were to embark.“What is the meaning of all this, Jup?”\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI inquired.“Him syfe, massa, and spade.”“Very true; but what are they doing here?”“Him de syfe and de spade what\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMassa Will sis pon my buying for him in de town, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nde debbils own lot of money I had to gib for em.”“But what, in the name of all\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthat is mysterious, is your ‘Massa Will’\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ngoing to do with scythes and spades?”“Dat’s more dan I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nknow, and debbil take me if I don’t blieve ’tis\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmore dan he know, too.  But it’s all\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncum ob do bug.”Finding that no satisfaction was to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbe obtained of Jupiter, whose whole intellect seemed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto be absorbed by “de bug,” I now stepped\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninto the boat and made sail.  With a fair and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nstrong breeze we soon ran into the little cove to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe northward of Fort Moultrie, and a walk of some\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntwo miles brought us to the hut.  It was about\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthree in the afternoon when we arrived.  Legrand\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhad been awaiting us in eager expectation.  He\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ngrasped my hand with a nervous empressement which\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nalarmed me and strengthened the suspicions already\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nentertained.  His countenance was pale even to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nghastliness, and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlustre.  After some inquiries respecting his health,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI asked him, not knowing what better to say, if he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhad yet obtained the scarabÃ¦us from Lieutenant G\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n  .“Oh, yes,” he replied,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncoloring violently, “I got it from him the next\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmorning.  Nothing should tempt me to part with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthat scarabÃ¦us.  Do you know that Jupiter is\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nquite right about it?”“In what way?” I asked, with a sad foreboding\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nat heart.“In supposing it to be a bug\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof real gold.”  He said this with an air\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof profound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nshocked.“This bug is to make my fortune,”\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe continued, with a triumphant smile, “to reinstate\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nme in my family possessions.  Is it any wonder,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthen, that I prize it?  Since Fortune has thought\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfit to bestow it upon me, I have only to use it properly\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand I shall arrive at the gold of which it is the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nindex.  Jupiter; bring me that scarabÃ¦us!”“What! de bug, massa?  I’d\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nrudder not go fer trubble dat bug ­you\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmus git him for your own self.” \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHereupon Legrand arose, with a grave and stately air,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand brought me the beetle from a glass case in which\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit was enclosed.  It was a beautiful scarabÃ¦us,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand, at that time, unknown to naturalists ­of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncourse a great prize in a scientific point of view. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThere were two round, black spots near one extremity\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the back, and a long one near the other.  The\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nscales were exceedingly hard and glossy, with all\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe appearance of burnished gold.  The weight of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe insect was very remarkable, and, taking all things\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninto consideration, I could hardly blame Jupiter for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhis opinion respecting it; but what to make of Legrand’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconcordance with that opinion, I could not, for the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlife of me, tell.“I sent for you,” said\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe, in a grandiloquent tone, when I had completed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmy examination of the beetle, “I sent for you,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthat I might have your counsel and assistance in furthering\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe views of Fate and of the bug” ­“My dear Legrand,” I cried,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninterrupting him, “you are certainly unwell,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand had better use some little precautions.  You\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nshall go to bed, and I will remain with you a few\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndays, until you get over this.  You are feverish\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand” ­“Feel my pulse,” said he.I felt it, and, to say the truth,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfound not the slightest indication of fever.“But you may be ill and yet\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhave no fever.  Allow me this once to prescribe\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor you.  In the first place, go to bed.  In\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe next” ­“You are mistaken,” he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninterposed, “I am as well as I can expect to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbe under the excitement which I suffer.  If you\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nreally wish me well, you will relieve this excitement.”“And how is this to be done?”“Very easily.  Jupiter and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmyself are going upon an expedition into the hills,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nupon the main land, and, in this expedition we shall\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nneed the aid of some person in whom we can confide. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nYou are the only one we can trust.  Whether we\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsucceed or fail, the excitement which you now perceive\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin me will be equally allayed.”“I am anxious to oblige you\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin any way,” I replied; “but do you mean\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto say that this infernal beetle has any connection\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith your expedition into the hills?”“It has.”“Then, Legrand, I can become a party to no such\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nabsurd proceeding.”“I am sorry ­very sorry ­for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwe shall have to try it by ourselves.”“Try it by yourselves! \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe man is surely mad! ­but stay! ­how\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlong do you propose to be absent?”“Probably all night.  We\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nshall start immediately, and be back, at all events,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nby sunrise.”“And will you promise me, upon\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyour honor, that when this freak of yours is over,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand the bug business (good God!) settled to your satisfaction,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyou will then return home and follow my advice implicitly,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nas that of your physician?”“Yes; I promise; and now let\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nus be off, for we have no time to lose.”With a heavy heart I accompanied my\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfriend.  We started about four o’clock ­Legrand,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nJupiter, the dog, and myself.  Jupiter had with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhim the scythe and spades ­the whole of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhich he insisted upon carrying ­more through\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfear, it seemed to me, of trusting either of the implements\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwithin reach of his master, than from any excess of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nindustry or complaisance.  His demeanor was dogged\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin the extreme, and “dat deuced bug” were\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe sole words which escaped his lips during the journey. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nFor my own part, I had charge of a couple of dark\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlanterns, while Legrand contented himself with the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nscarabÃ¦us, which he carried attached to the end of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and fro, with the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nair of a conjuror, as he went.  When I observed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthis last, plain evidence of my friend’s aberration\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof mind, I could scarcely refrain from tears. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI thought it best, however, to humor his fancy, at\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nleast for the present, or until I could adopt some\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmore energetic measures with a chance of success. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIn the mean time I endeavored, but all in vain, to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsound him in regard to the object of the expedition. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHaving succeeded in inducing me to accompany him,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntopic of minor importance, and to all my questions\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nvouchsafed no other reply than “we shall see!”We crossed the creek at the head of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe island by means of a skiff; and, ascending the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhigh grounds on the shore of the main land, proceeded\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin a northwesterly direction, through a tract of country\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nexcessively wild and desolate, where no trace of a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhuman footstep was to be seen.  Legrand led the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nway with decision; pausing only for an instant, here\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand there, to consult what appeared to be certain\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlandmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion.In this manner we journeyed for about\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntwo hours, and the sun was just setting when we entered\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIt was a species of table land, near the summit of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nan almost inaccessible hill, densely wooded from base\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto pinnacle, and interspersed with huge crags that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nappeared to lie loosely upon the soil, and in many\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncases were prevented from precipitating themselves\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninto the valleys below, merely by the support of the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntrees against which they reclined.  Deep ravines,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin various directions, gave an air of still sterner\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsolemnity to the scene.The natural platform to which we had\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nclambered was thickly overgrown with brambles, through\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhich we soon discovered that it would have been impossible\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto force our way but for the scythe; and Jupiter, by\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndirection of his master, proceeded to clear for us\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na path to the foot of an enormously tall tulip-tree,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhich stood, with some eight or ten oaks, upon the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlevel, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhich I had then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand form, in the wide spread of its branches, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin the general majesty of its appearance.  When\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwe reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nasked him if he thought he could climb it.  The\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nold man seemed a little staggered by the question,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand for some moments made no reply.  At length\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe approached the huge trunk, walked slowly around\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit, and examined it with minute attention.  When\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe had completed his scrutiny, he merely said,“Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he ebber see\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin he life.”“Then up with you as soon as\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npossible, for it will soon be too dark to see what\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwe are about.”“How far mus go up, massa?”\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninquired Jupiter.“Get up the main trunk first,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand then I will tell you which way to go ­and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhere ­stop! take this beetle with you.”“De bug, Massa Will! ­de\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ngoole bug!” cried the negro, drawing back in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndismay ­“what for mus tote de\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbug way up de tree? ­d-n if I do!”“If you are afraid, Jup, a great\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbig negro like you, to take hold of a harmless little\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndead beetle, why you can carry it up by this string ­but,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nif you do not take it up with you in some way, I shall\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbe under the necessity of breaking your head with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthis shovel.”“What de matter now, massa?”\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsaid Jup, evidently shamed into compliance; “always\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwant for to raise fuss wid old nigger.  Was only\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfunnin any how.  Me feered de bug! what I keer\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor de bug?” Here he took cautiously hold of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe extreme end of the string, and, maintaining the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninsect as far from his person as circumstances would\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npermit, prepared to ascend the tree.In youth, the tulip-tree, or Liriodendron\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nTulipferum, the most magnificent of American foresters,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhas a trunk peculiarly smooth, and often rises to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na great height without lateral branches; but, in its\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nriper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmany short limbs make their appearance on the stem. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThus the difficulty of ascension, in the present case,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlay more in semblance than in reality.  Embracing\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe huge cylinder, as closely as possible, with his\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}narms and knees, seizing with his hands some projections,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand resting his naked toes upon others, Jupiter, after\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}none or two narrow escapes from falling, at length\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwriggled himself into the first great fork, and seemed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto consider the whole business as virtually accomplished. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe risk of the achievement was, in fact, now over,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nalthough the climber was some sixty or seventy feet\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom the ground.“Which way mus go now, Massa Will?”\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe asked.“Keep up the largest branch ­the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}none on this side,” said Legrand.  The negro\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nobeyed him promptly, and apparently with but little\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntrouble; ascending higher and higher, until no glimpse\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof his squat figure could be obtained through the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndense foliage which enveloped it.  Presently his\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nvoice was heard in a sort of halloo.“How much fudder is got for go?”“How high up are you?” asked Legrand.“Ebber so fur,” replied\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe negro; “can see de sky fru de top ob\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nde tree.”“Never mind the sky, but attend\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto what I say.  Look down the trunk and count\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe limbs below you on this side.  How many limbs\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhave you passed?”“One, two, tree, four, fibe ­I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndone pass fibe big limb, massa, pon dis\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nside.”“Then go one limb higher.”In a few minutes the voice was heard\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nagain, announcing that the seventh limb was attained.“Now, Jup,” cried Legrand,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nevidently much excited, “I want you to work\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyour way out upon that limb as far as you can. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIf you see anything strange, let me know.” \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBy this time what little doubt I might have entertained\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof my poor friend’s insanity, was put finally\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nat rest.  I had no alternative but to conclude\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhim stricken with lunacy, and I became seriously anxious\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nabout getting him home.  While I was pondering\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nupon what was best to be done, Jupiter’s voice\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwas again heard.“Mos feerd for to ventur pon\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndis limb berry far ­tis dead limb putty\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmuch all de way.”“Did you say it was a dead limb,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nJupiter?” cried Legrand in a quavering voice.“Yes, massa, him dead as de\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndoor-nail ­done up for sartain ­done\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndeparted dis here life.”“What in the name heaven shall\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI do?” asked Legrand, seemingly in the greatest\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndistress.  “Do!” said I, glad of an\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nopportunity to interpose a word, “why come home\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand go to bed.  Come now! ­that’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na fine fellow.  It’s getting late, and,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbesides, you remember your promise.”“Jupiter,” cried he, without\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nheeding me in the least, “do you hear me?”“Yes, Massa Will, hear you ebber so plain.”“Try the wood well, then, with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyour knife, and see if you think it very rotten.”“Him rotten, massa, sure nuff,”\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nreplied the negro in a few moments, “but not\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nso berry rotten as mought be.  Mought ventur out\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nleetle way pon de limb by myself, dat’s true.”“By yourself! ­what do you mean?”“Why I mean de bug.  ’Tis\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nberry hebby bug.  Spose I drop him down fuss,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand den de limb won’t break wid just de weight\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nob one nigger.”“You infernal scoundrel!”\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncried Legrand, apparently much relieved, “what\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndo you mean by telling me such nonsense as that? \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAs sure as you drop that beetle I’ll break your\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nneck.  Look here, Jupiter, do you hear me?”“Yes, massa, needn’t hollo at poor nigger\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndat style.”“Well! now listen! ­if\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyou will venture out on the limb as far as you think\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsafe, and not let go the beetle, I’ll make you\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na present of a silver dollar as soon as you get down.”“I’m gwine, Massa Will ­deed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI is,” replied the negro very promptly ­“mos\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nout to the eend now.”“Out to the end!” here\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfairly screamed Legrand, “do you say you are\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nout to the end of that limb?”“Soon be to de eend, massa, ­o-o-o-o-oh! \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nLor-gol-a-marcy! what is dis here pon de\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntree?”“Well!” cried Legrand, highly delighted,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n“what is it?”“Why taint noffin but a skull ­somebody\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbin lef him head up de tree, and de crows done gobble\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nebery bit ob de meat off.”“A skull, you say! ­very\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwell! ­how is it fastened to the limb? ­what\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nholds it on?”“Sure nuff, massa; mus\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlook.  Why dis berry curous sarcumstance,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npon my word ­dare’s a great big nail\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin de skull, what fastens ob it on to de tree.”“Well now, Jupiter, do exactly\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nas I tell you ­do you hear?”“Yes, massa.”“Pay attention, then! ­find the left\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}neye of the skull.”“Hum! hoo! dat’s good! why dare aint no\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}neye lef at all.”“Curse your stupidity! do you know your right\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhand from your left?”“Yes, I nose dat ­nose\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nall bout dat ­tis my lef hand what I chops\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nde wood wid.”“To be sure! you are left-handed;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand your left eye is on the same side as your left\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhand.  Now, I suppose, you can find the left eye\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the skull, or the place where the left eye has\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbeen.  Have you found it?”Here was a long pause.  At length the negro asked,“Is de lef eye of de skull pon\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nde same side as de lef hand of de skull, too? ­cause\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nde skull aint got not a bit ob a hand at all ­nebber\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmind!  I got de lef eye now ­here de\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlef eye! what mus do wid it?”“Let the beetle drop through\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit, as far as the string will reach ­but\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbe careful and not let go your hold of the string.”“All dat done, Massa Will; mighty\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}neasy ting for to put de bug fru de hole ­look\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nout for him dare below!”During this colloquy no portion of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nJupiter’s person could be seen; but the beetle,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhich he had suffered to descend, was now visible at\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe end of the string, and glistened, like a globe\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof burnished gold, in the last rays of the setting\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsun, some of which still faintly illumined the eminence\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nupon which we stood.  The scarabÃ¦us hung quite\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nclear of any branches, and, if allowed to fall, would\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhave fallen at our feet.  Legrand immediately\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntook the scythe, and cleared with it a circular space,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthree or four yards in diameter, just beneath the insect,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand, having accomplished this, ordered Jupiter to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlet go the string and come down from the tree.Driving a peg, with great nicety,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninto the ground, at the precise spot where the beetle\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfell, my friend now produced from his pocket a tape\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmeasure.  Fastening one end of this at that point\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the trunk, of the tree which was nearest the peg,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe unrolled it till it reached the peg, and thence\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfarther unrolled it, in the direction already established\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nby the two points of the tree and the peg, for the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndistance of fifty feet ­Jupiter clearing\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}naway the brambles with the scythe.  At the spot\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthus attained a second peg was driven, and about this,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nas a centre, a rude circle, about four feet in diameter,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndescribed.  Taking now a spade himself, and giving\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}none to Jupiter and one to me, Legrand begged us to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nset about digging as quickly as possible.To speak the truth, I had no especial\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nrelish for such amusement at any time, and, at that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nparticular moment, would most willingly have declined\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit; for the night was coming on, and I felt much fatigued\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith the exercise already taken; but I saw no mode\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof escape, and was fearful of disturbing my poor friend’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nequanimity by a refusal.  Could I have depended,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nindeed, upon Jupiter’s aid, I would have had\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nno hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nby force; but I was too well assured of the old negro’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndisposition, to hope that he would assist me, under\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nany circumstances, in a personal contest with his master. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI made no doubt that the latter had been infected\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith some of the innumerable Southern superstitions\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nabout money buried, and that his phantasy had received\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconfirmation by the finding of the scarabÃ¦us, or,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nperhaps, by Jupiter’s obstinacy in maintaining\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit to be “a bug of real gold.”  A\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsuch suggestions ­especially if chiming\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin with favorite preconceived ideas ­and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthen I called to mind the poor fellow’s speech\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nabout the beetle’s being “the index of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhis fortune.”  Upon the whole, I was sadly\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nvexed and puzzled, but, at length, I concluded to make\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na virtue of necessity ­to dig with a good\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwill, and thus the sooner to convince the visionary,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nby ocular demonstration, of the fallacy of the opinions\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe entertained.The lanterns having been lit, we all\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfell to work with a zeal worthy a more rational cause;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand, as the glare fell upon our persons and implements,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI could not help thinking how picturesque a group we\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncomposed, and how strange and suspicious our labors\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmust have appeared to any interloper who, by chance,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmight have stumbled upon our whereabouts.We dug very steadily for two hours. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nLittle was said; and our chief embarrassment lay in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe yelpings of the dog, who took exceeding interest\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin our proceedings.  He, at length, became so obstreperous\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthat we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nstragglers in the vicinity; ­or, rather,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthis was the apprehension of Legrand; ­for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmyself, I should have rejoiced at any interruption\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhich might have enabled me to get the wanderer home. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe noise was, at length, very effectually silenced\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nby Jupiter, who, getting out of the hole with a dogged\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nair of deliberation, tied the brute’s mouth up\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith one of his suspenders, and then returned, with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na grave chuckle, to his task.When the time mentioned had expired,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwe had reached a depth of five feet, and yet no signs\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof any treasure became manifest.  A general pause\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nensued, and I began to hope that the farce was at an\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nend.  Legrand, however, although evidently much\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndisconcerted, wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWe had excavated the entire circle of four feet diameter,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand now we slightly enlarged the limit, and went to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe farther depth of two feet.  Still nothing\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nappeared.  The gold-seeker, whom I sincerely pitied,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nat length clambered from the pit, with the bitterest\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndisappointment imprinted upon every feature, and proceeded,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nslowly and reluctantly, to put on his coat, which\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe had thrown off at the beginning of his labor. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIn the mean time I made no remark.  Jupiter, at\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na signal from his master, began to gather up his tools. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThis done, and the dog having been unmuzzled, we turned\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin profound silence towards home.We had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin this direction, when, with a loud oath, Legrand\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nstrode up to Jupiter, and seized him by the collar. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfullest extent, let fall the spades, and fell upon\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhis knees.“You scoundrel,” said\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nLegrand, hissing out the syllables from between his\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nclenched teeth ­“you infernal black\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nvillain! ­speak, I tell you! ­answer\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nme this instant, without prevarication! ­which ­which\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nis your left eye?”“Oh, my golly, Massa Will! aint\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndis here my lef eye for sartain?” roared\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his right\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}norgan of vision, and holding it there with a desperate\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npertinacity, as if in immediate dread of his master’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nattempt at a gouge.“I thought so! ­I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nknew it! hurrah!” vociferated Legrand, letting\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe negro go, and executing a series of curvets and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncaracols, much to the astonishment of his valet, who,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}narising from his knees, looked, mutely, from his master\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto myself, and then from myself to his master.“Come! we must go back,”\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsaid the latter, “the game’s not up yet;”\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand he again led the way to the tulip-tree.“Jupiter,” said he, when\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwe reached its foot, “come here! was the skull\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnailed to the limb with the face outwards, or with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe face to the limb?”“De face was out, massa, so\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndat de crows could get at de eyes good, widout any\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntrouble.”“Well, then, was it this eye\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nor that through which you dropped the beetle?” ­here\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nLegrand touched each of Jupiter’s eyes.“Twas dis eye, massa ­de\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlef eye ­jis as you tell me,” and here\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit was his right eye that the negro indicated.“That will do ­must try it again.”Here my friend, about whose madness\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI now saw, or fancied that I saw, certain indications\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof method, removed the peg which marked the spot where\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwestward of its former position.  Taking, now,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe tape measure from the nearest point of the trunk\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto the peg, as before, and continuing the extension\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin a straight line to the distance of fifty feet, a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nspot was indicated, removed, by several yards, from\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe point at which we had been digging.Around the new position a circle,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsomewhat larger than in the former instance, was now\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndescribed, and we again set to work with the spades. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhat had occasioned the change in my thoughts, I felt\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nno longer any great aversion from the labor imposed. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI had become most unaccountably interested ­nay,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}neven excited.  Perhaps there was something, amid\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nall the extravagant demeanor of Legrand ­some\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nair of forethought, or of deliberation, which impressed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nme.  I dug eagerly, and now and then caught myself\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nactually looking, with something that very much resembled\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nexpectation, for the fancied treasure, the vision\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof which had demented my unfortunate companion. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAt a period when such vagaries of thought most fully\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npossessed me, and when we had been at work perhaps\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nan hour and a half, we were again interrupted by the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nviolent howlings of the dog.  His uneasiness, in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe first instance, had been, evidently, but the result\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof playfulness or caprice, but he now assumed a bitter\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand serious tone.  Upon Jupiter’s again\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nattempting to muzzle him, he made furious resistance,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand, leaping into the hole, tore up the mould frantically\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith his claws.  In a few seconds he had uncovered\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na mass of human bones, forming two complete skeletons,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nintermingled with several buttons of metal, and what\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nappeared to be the dust of decayed woollen.  One\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nor two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlarge Spanish knife, and, as we dug farther, three\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nor four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlight.At sight of these the joy of Jupiter\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncould scarcely be restrained, but the countenance\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof his master wore an air of extreme disappointment\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHe urged us, however, to continue our exertions, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe words were hardly uttered when I stumbled and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfell forward, having caught the toe of my boot in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nearth.We now worked in earnest, and never\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndid I pass ten minutes of more intense excitement. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDuring this interval we had fairly unearthed an oblong\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nchest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand wonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto some mineralizing process ­perhaps that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the Bi-chloride of Mercury.  This box was three\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfeet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na half feet deep.  It was firmly secured by bands\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof wrought iron, riveted, and forming a kind of open\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntrelliswork over the whole.  On each side of the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nchest, near the top, were three rings of iron ­six\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin all ­by means of which a firm hold could\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbe obtained by six persons.  Our utmost united\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nendeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin its bed.  We at once saw the impossibility\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof removing so great a weight.  Luckily, the sole\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThese we drew back ­trembling and panting\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith anxiety.  In an instant, a treasure of incalculable\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nvalue lay gleaming before us.  As the rays of the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlanterns fell within the pit, there flashed upwards\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na glow and a glare, from a confused heap of gold and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof jewels, that absolutely dazzled our eyes.I shall not pretend to describe the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfeelings with which I gazed.  Amazement was, of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncourse, predominant.  Legrand appeared exhausted\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith excitement, and spoke very few words.  Jupiter’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncountenance wore, for some minutes, as deadly a pallor\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nas it is possible, in nature of things, for any negro’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nvisage to assume.  He seemed stupified ­thunderstricken. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nPresently he fell upon his knees in the pit, and, burying\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhis naked arms up to the elbows in gold, let them\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthere remain, as if enjoying the luxury of a bath. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAt length, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na soliloquy,“And dis all cum ob\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nde goole-bug! de putty goole bug! de poor little\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ngoole-bug, what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nstyle!  Aint you shamed ob yourself, nigger? ­answer\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nme dat!”It became necessary, at last, that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI should arouse both master and valet to the expediency\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof removing the treasure.  It was growing late,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand it behooved us to make exertion, that we might\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nget every thing housed before daylight.  It was\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndifficult to say what should be done, and much time\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwas spent in deliberation ­so confused were\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe ideas of all.  We, finally, lightened the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbox by removing two thirds of its contents, when we\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwere enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhole.  The articles taken out were deposited among\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe brambles, and the dog left to guard them, with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nstrict orders from Jupiter neither, upon any pretence,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto stir from the spot, nor to open his mouth until\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nour return.  We then hurriedly made for home with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe chest; reaching the hut in safety, but after excessive\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntoil, at one o’clock in the morning.  Worn\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nout as we were, it was not in human nature to do more\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmediately.  We rested until two, and had supper;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nstarting for the hills immediately afterwards, armed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith three stout sacks, which, by good luck, were upon\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe premises.  A little before four we arrived\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nat the pit, divided the remainder of the booty, as\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nequally as might be, among us, and, leaving the holes\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nunfilled, again set out for the hut, at which, for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe second time, we deposited our golden burthens,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}njust as the first faint streaks of the dawn gleamed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom over the tree-tops in the East.We were now thoroughly broken down;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbut the intense excitement of the time denied us repose. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAfter an unquiet slumber of some three or four hours’\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nduration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof our treasure.The chest had been full to the brim,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand we spent the whole day, and the greater part of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe next night, in a scrutiny of its contents. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThere had been nothing like order or arrangement. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nEvery thing had been heaped in promiscuously. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHaving assorted all with care, we found ourselves\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npossessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsupposed.  In coin there was rather more than\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfour hundred and fifty thousand dollars ­estimating\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe value of the pieces, as accurately as we could,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nby the tables of the period.  There was not a particle\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof silver.  All was gold of antique date and of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ngreat variety ­French, Spanish, and German\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmoney, with a few English guineas, and some counters,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof which we had never seen specimens before. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThere were several very large and heavy coins, so\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nworn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThere was no American money.  The value of the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}njewels we found more difficulty in estimating. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThere were diamonds ­some of them exceedingly\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlarge and fine ­a hundred and ten in all,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand not one of them small; eighteen rubies of remarkable\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbrilliancy; ­three hundred and ten emeralds,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nall very beautiful; and twenty-one sapphires, with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nan opal.  These stones had all been broken from\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntheir settings and thrown loose in the chest. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe settings themselves, which we picked out from\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}namong the other gold, appeared to have been beaten\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nup with hammers, as if to prevent identification. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBesides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ngold ornaments; ­nearly two hundred massive\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfinger and earrings; ­rich chains ­thirty\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof these, if I remember; ­eighty-three very\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlarge and heavy crucifixes; ­five gold censers\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof great value; ­a prodigious golden punch\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbowl, ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBacchanalian figures; with two sword-handles exquisitely\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nembossed, and many other smaller articles which I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncannot recollect.  The weight of these valuables\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nexceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand in this estimate I have not included one hundred\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand ninety-seven superb gold watches; three of the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnumber being worth each five hundred dollars, if one. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMany of them were very old, and as time keepers valueless;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe works having suffered, more or less, from corrosion ­but\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nall were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWe estimated the entire contents of the chest, that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnight, at a million and a half of dollars; and upon\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n(a few being retained for our own use), it was found\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthat we had greatly undervalued the treasure. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWhen, at length, we had concluded our examination,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand the intense excitement of the time had, in some\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmeasure, subsided, Legrand, who saw that I was dying\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nriddle, entered into a full detail of all the circumstances\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconnected with it.“You remember;” said he,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n“the night when I handed you the rough sketch\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI had made of the scarabÃ¦us.  You recollect also,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthat I became quite vexed at you for insisting that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmy drawing resembled a death’s-head.  When\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyou first made this assertion I thought you were jesting;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbut afterwards I called to mind the peculiar spots\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}non the back of the insect, and admitted to myself\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthat your remark had some little foundation in fact. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nStill, the sneer at my graphic powers irritated me ­for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI am considered a good artist ­and, therefore,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhen you handed me the scrap of parchment, I was about\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire.”“The scrap of paper, you mean,” said I.“No; it had much of the appearance\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof paper, and at first I supposed it to be such, but\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhen I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at once,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto be a piece of very thin parchment.  It was quite\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndirty, you remember.  Well, as I was in the very\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nact of crumpling it up, my glance fell upon the sketch\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nat which you had been looking, and you may imagine\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmy astonishment when I perceived, in fact, the figure\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof a death’s-head just where, it seemed to me,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI had made the drawing of the beetle.  For a moment\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI was too much amazed to think with accuracy. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI knew that my design was very different in detail\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom this ­although there was a certain\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsimilarity in general outline.  Presently I took\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na candle, and seating myself at the other end of the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nroom, proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nUpon turning it over, I saw my own sketch upon the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nreverse, just as I had made it.  My first idea,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnow, was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof outline ­at the singular coincidence\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninvolved in the fact, that unknown to me, there should\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhave been a skull upon the other side of the parchment,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmediately beneath my figure of the scarabÃ¦us, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthat this skull, not only in outline, but in size,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nshould so closely resemble my drawing.  I say the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsingularity of this coincidence absolutely stupified\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nme for a time.  This is the usual effect of such\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncoincidences.  The mind struggles to establish\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na connexion ­a sequence of cause and effect ­and,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbeing unable to do so, suffers a species of temporary\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nparalysis.  But, when I recovered from this stupor,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthere dawned upon me gradually a conviction which\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nstartled me even far more than the coincidence. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI began distinctly, positively, to remember that there\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhad been no drawing upon the parchment when I made\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmy sketch of the scarabÃ¦us.  I became perfectly\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncertain of this; for I recollected turning up first\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}none side and then the other, in search of the cleanest\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nspot.  Had the skull been then there, of course\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI could not have failed to notice it.  Here was\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nindeed a mystery which I felt it impossible to explain;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbut, even at that early moment, there seemed to glimmer,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfaintly, within the most remote and secret chambers\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof my intellect, a glow-worm-like conception of that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntruth which last night’s adventure brought to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nso magnificent a demonstration.  I arose at once,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand putting the parchment securely away, dismissed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nall farther reflection until I should be alone.“When you had gone, and when\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nJupiter was fast asleep, I betook myself to a more\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmethodical investigation of the affair.  In the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfirst place I considered the manner in which the parchment\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhad come into my possession.  The spot where we\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndiscovered the scarabaeus was on the coast of the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmain land, about a mile eastward of the island, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbut a short distance above high water mark.  Upon\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmy taking hold of it, it gave me a sharp bite, which\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncaused me to let it drop.  Jupiter, with his accustomed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncaution, before seizing the insect, which had flown\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntowards him, looked about him for a leaf, or something\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof that nature, by which to take hold of it. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIt was at this moment that his eyes, and mine also,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfell upon the scrap of parchment, which I then supposed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto be paper.  It was lying half buried in the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsand, a corner sticking up.  Near the spot where\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwe found it, I observed the remnants of the hull of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhat appeared to have been a ship’s long boat. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe wreck seemed to have been there for a very great\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhile; for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbe traced.“Well, Jupiter picked up the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nparchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and gave it to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nme.  Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}non the way met Lieutenant G-.  I showed him the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninsect, and he begged me to let him take it to the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfort.  Upon my consenting, he thrust it forthwith\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninto his waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhich it had been wrapped, and which I had continued\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto hold in my hand during his inspection.  Perhaps\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it best\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto make sure of the prize at once ­you know\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhow enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nNatural History.  At the same time, without being\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconscious of it, I must have deposited the parchment\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin my own pocket.“You remember that when I went\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto the table, for the purpose of making a sketch of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe beetle, I found no paper where it was usually kept. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI looked in the drawer, and found none there. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI searched my pockets, hoping to find an old letter,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhen my hand fell upon the parchment.  I thus\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndetail the precise mode in which it came into my possession;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force.“No doubt you will think me\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfanciful ­but I had already established a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nkind of connexion.  I had put together two links\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof a great chain.  There was a boat lying upon\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na sea-coast, and not far from the boat was a parchment ­not\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na paper ­with a skull depicted upon it. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nYou will, of course, ask ‘where is the connexion?’\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI reply that the skull, or death’s-head, is\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe well-known emblem of the pirate.  The flag\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the death’s head is hoisted in all engagements.“I have said that the scrap\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwas parchment, and not paper.  Parchment is durable ­almost\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimperishable.  Matters of little moment are rarely\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconsigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npurposes of drawing or writing, it is not nearly so\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwell adapted as paper.  This reflection suggested\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsome meaning ­some relevancy ­in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe death’s-head.  I did not fail to observe,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nalso, the form of the parchment.  Although one\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof its corners had been, by some accident, destroyed,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit could be seen that the original form was oblong. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIt was just such a slip, indeed, as might have been\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nchosen for a memorandum ­for a record of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsomething to be long remembered and carefully preserved.”“But,” I interposed, “you\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsay that the skull was not upon the parchment when\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyou made the drawing of the beetle.  How then do\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyou trace any connexion between the boat and the skull ­since\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthis latter, according to your own admission, must\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhave been designed (God only knows how or by whom)\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nat some period subsequent to your sketching the scarabÃ¦us?”“Ah, hereupon turns the whole\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmystery; although the secret, at this point, I had\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncomparatively little difficulty in solving.  My\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsteps were sure, and could afford but a single result. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI reasoned, for example, thus:  When I drew the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nscarabÃ¦us, there was no skull apparent upon the parchment. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWhen I had completed the drawing I gave it to you,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand observed you narrowly until you returned it. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nYou, therefore, did not design the skull, and no one\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nelse was present to do it.  Then it was not done\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nby human agency.  And nevertheless it was done.“At this stage of my reflections\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI endeavored to remember, and did remember, with entire\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndistinctness, every incident which occurred about\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe period in question.  The weather was chilly\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n(oh rare and happy accident!), and a fire was blazing\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nupon the hearth.  I was heated with exercise and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsat near the table.  You, however, had drawn a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nchair close to the chimney.  Just as I placed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe parchment in your hand, and as you were in the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nact of inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand leaped upon your shoulders.  With your left\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhand you caressed him and kept him off, while your\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nright, holding the parchment, was permitted to fall\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlistlessly between your knees, and in close proximity\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto the fire.  At one moment I thought the blaze\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhad caught it, and was about to caution you, but,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbefore I could speak, you had withdrawn it, and were\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nengaged in its examination.  When I considered\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nall these particulars, I doubted not for a moment\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthat heat had been the agent in bringing to light,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nupon the parchment, the skull which I saw designed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nupon it.  You are well aware that chemical preparations\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nexist, and have existed time out of mind, by means\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof which it is possible to write upon either paper\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nor vellum, so that the characters shall become visible\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nonly when subjected to the action of fire.  Zaffre,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndigested in aqua regia, and diluted with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfour times its weight of water, is sometimes employed;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na green tint results.  The regulus of cobalt,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndissolved in spirit of nitre, gives a red.  These\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncolors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe material written upon cools, but again become apparent\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nupon the re-application of heat.“I now scrutinized the death’s-head\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith care.  Its outer edges ­the edges\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum ­were\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfar more distinct than the others.  It was clear\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthat the action of the caloric had been imperfect\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nor unequal.  I immediately kindled a fire, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsubjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nheat.  At first, the only effect was the strengthening\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the faint lines in the skull; but, upon persevering\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin the experiment, there became visible, at the corner\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe death’s-head was delineated, the figure\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof what I at first supposed to be a goat.  A closer\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nscrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was intended\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor a kid.”“Ha! ha!” said I, “to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbe sure I have no right to laugh at you ­a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmillion and a half of money is too serious a matter\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor mirth ­but you are not about to establish\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na third link in your chain ­you will not\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfind any especial connexion between your pirates and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na goat ­pirates, you know, have nothing\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto do with goats; they appertain to the farming interest.”“But I have just said that the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfigure was not that of a goat.”“Well, a kid then ­pretty much the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsame thing.”“Pretty much, but not altogether,”\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsaid Legrand.  “You may have heard of one\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nCaptain Kidd.  I at once looked upon the figure\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the animal as a kind of punning or hieroglyphical\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsignature.  I say signature; because its position\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nupon the vellum suggested this idea.  The death’s-head\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nat the corner diagonally opposite, had, in the same\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmanner, the air of a stamp, or seal.  But I was\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsorely put out by the absence of all else ­of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe body to my imagined instrument ­of the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntext for my context.”“I presume you expected to find\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na letter between the stamp and the signature.”“Something of that kind. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe fact is, I felt irresistibly impressed with a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npresentiment of some vast good fortune impending. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI can scarcely say why.  Perhaps, after all, it\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwas rather a desire than an actual belief; ­but\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndo you know that Jupiter’s silly words, about\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe bug being of solid gold, had a remarkable effect\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nupon my fancy?  And then the series of accidents\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand coincidences ­these were so very extraordinary. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDo you observe how mere an accident it was that these\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nevents should have occurred upon the sole day of all\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe year in which it has been, or may be, sufficiently\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncool for fire, and that without the fire, or without\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe intervention of the dog at the precise moment in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhich he appeared, I should never have become aware\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the death’s-head, and so never the possessor\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the treasure?”“But proceed ­I am all impatience.”“Well; you have heard, of course,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe many stories current ­the thousand vague\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nrumors afloat about money buried, somewhere upon the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAtlantic coast, by Kidd and his associates.  These\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nrumors must have had some foundation in fact. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAnd that the rumors have existed so long and so continuous,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncould have resulted, it appeared to me, only from the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncircumstance of the buried treasure still remaining\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nentombed.  Had Kidd concealed his plunder for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na time, and afterwards reclaimed it, the rumors would\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nscarcely have reached us in their present unvarying\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nform.  You will observe that the stories told\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nare all about money-seekers, not about money-finders. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHad the pirate recovered his money, there the affair\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwould have dropped.  It seemed to me that some\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}naccident ­say the loss of a memorandum indicating\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nits locality ­had deprived him of the means\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof recovering it, and that this accident had become\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nknown to his followers, who otherwise might never\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhave heard that treasure had been concealed at all,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand who, busying themselves in vain, because unguided\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nattempts, to regain it, had given first birth, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthen universal currency, to the reports which are\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnow so common.  Have you ever heard of any important\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntreasure being unearthed along the coast?”“Never.”“But that Kidd’s accumulations\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwere immense, is well known.  I took it for granted,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntherefore, that the earth still held them; and you\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwill scarcely be surprised when I tell you that I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfelt a hope, nearly amounting to certainty, that the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nparchment so strangely found, involved a lost record\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the place of deposit.”“But how did you proceed?”“I held the vellum again to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe fire, after increasing the heat; but nothing appeared. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI now thought it possible that the coating of dirt\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmight have something to do with the failure; so I carefully\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nrinsed the parchment by pouring warm water over it,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand, having done this, I placed it in a tin pan, with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe skull downwards, and put the pan upon a furnace\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof lighted charcoal.  In a few minutes, the pan\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhaving become thoroughly heated, I removed the slip,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand, to my inexpressible joy, found it spotted, in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nseveral places, with what appeared to be figures arranged\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin lines.  Again I placed it in the pan, and suffered\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit to remain another minute.  Upon taking it off,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe whole was just as you see it now.” \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHere Legrand, having re-heated the parchment, submitted\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit to my inspection.  The following characters\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwere rudely traced, in a red tint, between the death’s-head\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand the goat: “But,” said I, returning\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhim the slip, “I am as much in the dark as ever. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWere all the jewels of Golconda awaiting me upon my\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsolution of this enigma, I am quite sure that I should\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbe unable to earn them.”“And yet,” said Legrand,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n“the solution is by no means so difficult as\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyou might be lead to imagine from the first hasty inspection\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the characters.  These characters, as any one\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmight readily guess, form a cipher ­that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nis to say, they convey a meaning; but then, from what\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nis known of Kidd, I could not suppose him capable\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof constructing any of the more abstruse cryptographs. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI made up my mind, at once, that this was of a simple\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nspecies ­such, however, as would appear,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto the crude intellect of the sailor, absolutely insoluble\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwithout the key.”“And you really solved it?”“Readily; I have solved others\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof an abstruseness ten thousand times greater. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nCircumstances, and a certain bias of mind, have led\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nme to take interest in such riddles, and it may well\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbe doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nenigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nby proper application, resolve.  In fact, having\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nonce established connected and legible characters,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI scarcely gave a thought to the mere difficulty of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndeveloping their import.“In the present case ­indeed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin all cases of secret writing ­the first\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nquestion regards the language of the cipher; for the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nprinciples of solution, so far, especially, as the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmore simple ciphers are concerned, depend upon, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nare varied by, the genius of the particular idiom. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIn general, there is no alternative but experiment\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n(directed by probabilities) of every tongue known\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto him who attempts the solution, until the true one\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbe attained.  But, with the cipher now before us,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nall difficulty was removed by the signature. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe pun upon the word ‘Kidd’ is appreciable\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin no other language than the English.  But for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthis consideration I should have begun my attempts\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith the Spanish and French, as the tongues in which\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na secret of this kind would most naturally have been\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwritten by a pirate of the Spanish main.  As it\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwas, I assumed the cryptograph to be English.“You observe there are no divisions\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbetween the words.  Had there been divisions,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe task would have been comparatively easy.  In\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsuch case I should have commenced with a collation\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand analysis of the shorter words, and, had a word\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof a single letter occurred, as is most likely, (a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nor I, for example,) I should have considered the solution\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nas assured.  But, there being no division, my\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfirst step was to ascertain the predominant letters,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nas well as the least frequent.  Counting all, I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconstructed a table, thus: Of the character 8 there are 33.; \" 26.4 \" 19.\\textbackslash{}u0087 ) \" 16. \" 13.5 \" 12.6 \" 11.\\textbackslash{}u0086 1 \" 8.0 \" 6.9 2 \" 5.:  3 \" 4.? \" 3.¶ \" 2.“Now, in English, the letter\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhich most frequently occurs is e.  Afterwards,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsuccession runs thus:  a o i d h n r s t u y\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nc f g l m w b k p q x z. E predominates\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nso remarkably that an individual sentence of any length\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nis rarely seen, in which it is not the prevailing character.“Here, then, we leave, in the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nvery beginning, the groundwork for something more\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthan a mere guess.  The general use which may be\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmade of the table is obvious ­but, in this\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nparticular cipher, we shall only very partially require\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nits aid.  As our predominant character is 8, we\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwill commence by assuming it as the e of the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnatural alphabet.  To verify the supposition,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlet us observe if the 8 be seen often in couples ­for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ne is doubled with great frequency in English ­in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsuch words, for example, as ‘meet,’ ‘.fleet,’\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n‘speed,’ ‘seen,’ been,’\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n‘agree,’ \\&c.  In the present instance\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwe see it doubled no less than five times, although\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe cryptograph is brief.“Let us assume 8, then, as e. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nNow, of all words in the language, ‘the’\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nis most usual; let us see, therefore, whether there\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nare not repetitions of any three characters, in the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsame order of collocation, the last of them being\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n8.  If we discover repetitions of such letters,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nso arranged, they will most probably represent the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nword ‘the.’  Upon inspection, we find\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nno less than seven such arrangements, the characters\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbeing;48.  We may, therefore, assume that; represents\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nt, 4 represents h, and 8 represents\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ne ­the last being now well confirmed. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThus a great step has been taken.“But, having established a single\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nword, we are enabled to establish a vastly important\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npoint; that is to say, several commencements and terminations\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof other words.  Let us refer, for example, to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe last instance but one, in which the combination;48\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}noccurs ­not far from the end of the cipher. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWe know that the; immediately ensuing is the commencement\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof a word, and, of the six characters succeeding this\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n‘the,’ we are cognizant of no less than\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfive.  Let us set these characters down, thus,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nby the letters we know them to represent, leaving\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na space for the unknown ­t eeth.“Here we are enabled, at once,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto discard the ‘th,’ as forming no portion\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the word commencing with the first t; since, by\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nexperiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto the vacancy, we perceive that no word can be formed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof which this th can be a part.  We are\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthus narrowed intot ee,and, going through the alphabet, if\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnecessary, as before, we arrive at the word ‘tree,’\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nas the sole possible reading.  We thus gain another\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nletter, r, represented by (, with the words\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n‘the tree’ in juxtaposition.“Looking beyond these words,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor a short distance, we again see the combination;48,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand employ it by way of termination to what\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmediately precedes.  We have thus this arrangement: the tree;4(Â\\textbackslash{}u0087?34 the,or, substituting the natural letters,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhere known, it reads thus: the tree thrÂ\\textbackslash{}u0087?3h the.“Now, if, in place of the unknown\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncharacters, we leave blank spaces, or substitute dots,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwe read thus: the tree thr...h the,when the word ‘through’\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmakes itself evident at once.  But this discovery\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ngives us three new letters, o, u and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ng, represented by Â\\textbackslash{}u0087? and 3.“Looking now, narrowly, through\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe cipher for combinations of known characters, we\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfind, not very far from the beginning, this arrangement,83(88, or egree,which, plainly, is the conclusion\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the word ‘degree,’ and gives us another\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nletter, d, represented by Â\\textbackslash{}u0086.“Four letters beyond the word\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n‘degree,’ we perceive the combination;46(;88.“Translating the known characters,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand representing the unknown by dots, as before, we\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nread thus:  th rtee. an arrangement immediately\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsuggestive of the word ‘thirteen,’ and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nagain furnishing us with two new characters, i\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand n, represented by 6 and .“Referring, now, to the beginning\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the cryptograph, we find the combination,53Â\\textbackslash{}u0087Â\\textbackslash{}u0087Â\\textbackslash{}u0086.“Translating, as before, we obtaingood,which assures us that the first letter\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nis A, and that the first two words are ‘A\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ngood.’“It is now time that we arrange\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nour key, as far as discovered, in a tabular form,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto avoid confusion.  It will stand thus: 5 represents      aÂ\\textbackslash{}u0086       \"        \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nd8       \"         e3       \"         g4       \"         h6       \"         i       \"         nÂ\\textbackslash{}u0087       \"        \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}no(        \"        \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nr;

during which\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI made diligent inquiry, in the neighborhood of Sullivan’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIsland, for any building which went by the name of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe ‘Bishop’s Hotel;’ for, of course,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI dropped the obsolete word ‘hostel.’ \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nGaining no information on the subject, I was on the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npoint of extending my sphere of search, and proceeding\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin a more systematic manner, when, one morning, it\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nentered into my head, quite suddenly, that this ‘Bishop’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHostel’ might have some reference to an old\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfamily, of the name of Bessop, which, time out of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmind, had held possession of an ancient manor-house,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nabout four miles to the northward of the Island. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI accordingly went over to the plantation, and re-instituted\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmy inquiries among the older negroes of the place. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAt length one of the most aged of the women said that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nshe had heard of such a place as Bessop’s Castle,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand thought that she could guide me to it, but that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit was not a castle nor a tavern, but a high rock.“I offered to pay her well for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nher trouble, and, after some demur, she consented\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto accompany me to the spot.  We found it without\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmuch difficulty, when, dismissing her, I proceeded\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto examine the place.  The ‘castle’\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconsisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nrocks ­one of the latter being quite remarkable\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor its height as well as for its insulated and artificial\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nappearance I clambered to its apex, and then felt\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmuch at a loss as to what should be next done.“While I was busied in reflection,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmy eyes fell upon a narrow ledge in the eastern face\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the rock, perhaps a yard below the summit upon which\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI stood.  This ledge projected about eighteen inches,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand was not more than a foot wide, while a niche in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe cliff just above it, gave it a rude resemblance\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto one of the hollow-backed chairs used by our ancestors. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI made no doubt that here was the ‘devil’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nseat’ alluded to in the MS., and now I seemed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto grasp the full secret of the riddle.“The ‘good glass,’\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI knew, could have reference to nothing but a telescope;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor the word ‘glass’ is rarely employed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin any other sense by seamen.  Now here, I at\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nonce saw, was a telescope to be used, and a definite\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npoint of view, admitting no variation, from which to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nuse it.  Nor did I hesitate to believe that the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nphrases, “forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes,’\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand ‘northeast and by north,’ were intended\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nas directions for the levelling of the glass. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nGreatly excited by these discoveries, I hurried home,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nprocured a telescope, and returned to the rock.“I let myself down to the ledge,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand found that it was impossible to retain a seat\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nupon it except in one particular position.  This\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfact confirmed my preconceived idea.  I proceeded\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto use the glass.  Of course, the ‘forty-one\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndegrees and thirteen minutes’ could allude to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnothing but elevation above the visible horizon, since\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe horizontal direction was clearly indicated by\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe words, ‘northeast and by north.’ \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThis latter direction I at once established by means\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof a pocket-compass; then, pointing the glass as nearly\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nat an angle of forty-one degrees of elevation as I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncould do it by guess, I moved it cautiously up or down,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nuntil my attention was arrested by a circular rift\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nor opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtopped\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nits fellows in the distance.  In the centre of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthis rift I perceived a white spot, but could not,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nat first, distinguish what it was.  Adjusting\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe focus of the telescope, I again looked, and now\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmade it out to be a human skull.“Upon this discovery I was so\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsanguine as to consider the enigma solved; for the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nphrase ‘main branch, seventh limb, east side,’\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncould refer only to the position of the skull upon\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe tree, while ’shoot from the left eye of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe death’s head’ admitted, also, of but\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}none interpretation, in regard to a search for buried\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntreasure.  I perceived that the design was to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndrop a bullet from the left eye of the skull, and that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na bee-line, or, in other words, a straight line, drawn\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom the nearest point of the trunk through ‘the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nshot,’ (or the spot where the bullet fell,) and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthence extended to a distance of fifty feet, would\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nindicate a definite point ­and beneath this\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npoint I thought it at least possible that a deposit\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof value lay concealed.”“All this,” I said, “is\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nexceedingly clear, and, although ingenious, still\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsimple and explicit.  When you left the Bishop’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHotel, what then?”“Why, having carefully taken\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe bearings of the tree, I turned homewards. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe instant that I left ‘the devil’s seat,’\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhowever, the circular rift vanished; nor could I get\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na glimpse of it afterwards, turn as I would. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWhat seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbusiness, is the fact (for repeated experiment has\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconvinced me it is a fact) that the circular opening\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin question is visible from no other attainable point\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof view than that afforded by the narrow ledge upon\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe face of the rock.“In this expedition to the ‘Bishop’s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHotel’ I had been attended by Jupiter, who had,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nno doubt, observed, for some weeks past, the abstraction\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof my demeanor, and took especial care not to leave\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nme alone.  But, on the next day, getting up very\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nearly, I contrived to give him the slip, and went\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninto the hills in search of the tree.  After much\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntoil I found it.  When I came home at night my\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nvalet proposed to give me a flogging.  With the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nrest of the adventure I believe you are as well acquainted\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nas myself.”“I suppose,” said I, “you\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmissed the spot, in the first attempt at digging,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthrough Jupiter’s stupidity in letting the bug\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfall through the right instead of through the left\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}neye of the skull.”“Precisely.  This mistake\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmade a difference of about two inches and a half in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe ’shot’ ­that is to say, in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe position of the peg nearest the tree; and had\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe treasure been beneath the ‘shot,’ the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nerror would have been of little moment; but ‘the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nshot,’ together with the nearest point of the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntree, were merely two points for the establishment\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof a line of direction; of course the error, however\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntrivial in the beginning, increased as we proceeded\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith the line, and by the time we had gone fifty feet,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthrew us quite off the scent.  But for my deep-seated\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimpressions that treasure was here somewhere actually\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nburied, we might have had all our labor in vain.”“But your grandiloquence, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyour conduct in swinging the beetle ­how\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nexcessively odd!  I was sure you were mad. \\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAnd why did you insist upon letting fall the bug,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninstead of a bullet, from the skull?”“Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nannoyed by your evident suspicions touching my sanity,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand so resolved to punish you quietly, in my own way,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nby a little bit of sober mystification.  For this\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nreason I swung the beetle, and for this reason I let\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit fall it from the tree.  An observation of yours\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nabout its great weight suggested the latter idea.”“Yes, I perceive; and now there\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nis only one point which puzzles me.  What are\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwe to make of the skeletons found in the hole?”“That is a question I am no\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmore able to answer than yourself.  There seems,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhowever, only one plausible way of accounting for them ­and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmy suggestion would imply.  It is clear that Kidd ­if\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nKidd indeed secreted this treasure, which I doubt\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnot ­it is clear that he must have had assistance\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin the labor.  But this labor concluded, he may\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhave thought it expedient to remove all participants\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin his secret.  Perhaps a couple of blows with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na mattock were sufficient, while his coadjutors were\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbusy in the pit; perhaps it required a dozen ­who\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nshall tell?”'"

       "<span style=white-space:pre-wrap>'          What\\r\\nho! what ho! this fellow is dancing mad!He hath been bitten\\r\\nby the Tarantula._ ­All\\r\\nin the Wrong._MANY years ago, I contracted an intimacy\\r\\nwith a Mr. William Legrand.  He was of an ancient\\r\\nHuguenot family, and had once been wealthy; but a\\r\\nseries of misfortunes had reduced him to want. \\r\\nTo avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters,\\r\\nhe left New Orleans, the city of his forefathers,\\r\\nand took up his residence at Sullivan’s Island,\\r\\nnear Charleston, South Carolina.  This Island is\\r\\na very singular one.  It consists of little else\\r\\nthan the sea sand, and is about three miles long. \\r\\nIts breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile. \\r\\nIt is separated from the main land by a scarcely perceptible\\r\\ncreek, oozing its way through a wilderness of reeds\\r\\nand slime, a favorite resort of the marsh hen. \\r\\nThe vegetation, as might be supposed, is scant, or\\r\\nat least dwarfish.  No trees of any magnitude\\r\\nare to be seen.  Near the western extremity, where\\r\\nFort Moultrie stands, and where are some miserable\\r\\nframe buildings, tenanted, during summer, by the fugitives\\r\\nfrom Charleston dust and fever, may be found, indeed,\\r\\nthe bristly palmetto; but the whole island, with the\\r\\nexception of this western point, and a line of hard,\\r\\nwhite beach on the seacoast, is covered with a dense\\r\\nundergrowth of the sweet myrtle, so much prized by\\r\\nthe horticulturists of England.  The shrub here\\r\\noften attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet,\\r\\nand forms an almost impenetrable coppice, burthening\\r\\nthe air with its fragrance.In the inmost recesses of this coppice,\\r\\nnot far from the eastern or more remote end of the\\r\\nisland, Legrand had built himself a small hut, which\\r\\nhe occupied when I first, by mere accident, made his\\r\\nacquaintance.  This soon ripened into friendship ­for\\r\\nthere was much in the recluse to excite interest and\\r\\nesteem.  I found him well educated, with unusual\\r\\npowers of mind, but infected with misanthropy, and\\r\\nsubject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm\\r\\nand melancholy.  He had with him many books, but\\r\\nrarely employed them.  His chief amusements were\\r\\ngunning and fishing, or sauntering along the beach\\r\\nand through the myrtles, in quest of shells or entomological\\r\\nspecimens; ­his collection of the latter\\r\\nmight have been envied by a Swammerdamm.  In these\\r\\nexcursions he was usually accompanied by an old negro,\\r\\ncalled Jupiter, who had been manumitted before the\\r\\nreverses of the family, but who could be induced,\\r\\nneither by threats nor by promises, to abandon what\\r\\nhe considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps\\r\\nof his young “Massa Will.”  It is\\r\\nnot improbable that the relatives of Legrand, conceiving\\r\\nhim to be somewhat unsettled in intellect, had contrived\\r\\nto instil this obstinacy into Jupiter, with a view\\r\\nto the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer.The winters in the latitude of Sullivan’s\\r\\nIsland are seldom very severe, and in the fall of\\r\\nthe year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is\\r\\nconsidered necessary.  About the middle of October,\\r\\n18-, there occurred, however, a day of remarkable\\r\\nchilliness.  Just before sunset I scrambled my\\r\\nway through the evergreens to the hut of my friend,\\r\\nwhom I had not visited for several weeks ­my\\r\\nresidence being, at that time, in Charleston, a distance\\r\\nof nine miles from the Island, while the facilities\\r\\nof passage and re-passage were very far behind those\\r\\nof the present day.  Upon reaching the hut I rapped,\\r\\nas was my custom, and getting no reply, sought for\\r\\nthe key where I knew it was secreted, unlocked the\\r\\ndoor and went in.  A fine fire was blazing upon\\r\\nthe hearth.  It was a novelty, and by no means\\r\\nan ungrateful one.  I threw off an overcoat, took\\r\\nan arm-chair by the crackling logs, and awaited patiently\\r\\nthe arrival of my hosts.Soon after dark they arrived, and\\r\\ngave me a most cordial welcome.  Jupiter, grinning\\r\\nfrom ear to ear, bustled about to prepare some marsh-hens\\r\\nfor supper.  Legrand was in one of his fits ­how\\r\\nelse shall I term them? ­of enthusiasm. \\r\\nHe had found an unknown bivalve, forming a new genus,\\r\\nand, more than this, he had hunted down and secured,\\r\\nwith Jupiter’s assistance, a scarabÃ¦us which\\r\\nhe believed to be totally new, but in respect to which\\r\\nhe wished to have my opinion on the morrow.“And why not to-night?”\\r\\nI asked, rubbing my hands over the blaze, and wishing\\r\\nthe whole tribe of scarabÃ¦i at the devil.“Ah, if I had only known you\\r\\nwere here!” said Legrand, “but it’s\\r\\nso long since I saw you; and how could I foresee that\\r\\nyou would pay me a visit this very night of all others? \\r\\nAs I was coming home I met Lieutenant G ­,\\r\\nfrom the fort, and, very foolishly, I lent him the\\r\\nbug; so it will be impossible for you to see it until\\r\\nthe morning.  Stay here to-night, and I will send\\r\\nJup down for it at sunrise.  It is the loveliest\\r\\nthing in creation!”“What? ­sunrise?”“Nonsense! no! ­the\\r\\nbug.  It is of a brilliant gold color ­about\\r\\nthe size of a large hickory-nut ­with two\\r\\njet black spots near one extremity of the back, and\\r\\nanother, somewhat longer, at the other.  The antennÃ¦\\r\\nare ­”“Dey aint no tin in him, Massa\\r\\nWill, I keep a tellin on you,” here interrupted\\r\\nJupiter; “de bug is a goole bug, solid, ebery\\r\\nbit of him, inside and all, sep him wing ­neber\\r\\nfeel half so hebby a bug in my life.”“Well, suppose it is, Jup,”\\r\\nreplied Legrand, somewhat more earnestly, it seemed\\r\\nto me, than the case demanded, “is that any reason\\r\\nfor your letting the birds burn?  The color” ­here\\r\\nhe turned to me ­“is really almost\\r\\nenough to warrant Jupiter’s idea.  You never\\r\\nsaw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales\\r\\nemit ­but of this you cannot judge till\\r\\ntomorrow.  In the mean time I can give you some\\r\\nidea of the shape.”  Saying this, he seated\\r\\nhimself at a small table, on which were a pen and\\r\\nink, but no paper.  He looked for some in a drawer,\\r\\nbut found none.“Never mind,” said he\\r\\nat length, “this will answer;” and he drew\\r\\nfrom his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to\\r\\nbe very dirty foolscap, and made upon it a rough drawing\\r\\nwith the pen.  While he did this, I retained my\\r\\nseat by the fire, for I was still chilly.  When\\r\\nthe design was complete, he handed it to me without\\r\\nrising.  As I received it, a loud growl was heard,\\r\\nsucceeded by a scratching at the door.  Jupiter\\r\\nopened it, and a large Newfoundland, belonging to Legrand,\\r\\nrushed in, leaped upon my shoulders, and loaded me\\r\\nwith caresses; for I had shown him much attention\\r\\nduring previous visits.  When his gambols were\\r\\nover, I looked at the paper, and, to speak the truth,\\r\\nfound myself not a little puzzled at what my friend\\r\\nhad depicted.“Well!” I said, after\\r\\ncontemplating it for some minutes, “this is a\\r\\nstrange scarabÃ¦us, I must confess:  new to me: \\r\\nnever saw anything like it before ­unless\\r\\nit was a skull, or a death’s-head ­which\\r\\nit more nearly resembles than anything else that has\\r\\ncome under my observation.”“A death’s-head!”\\r\\nechoed Legrand ­“Oh ­yes ­well,\\r\\nit has something of that appearance upon paper, no\\r\\ndoubt.  The two upper black spots look like eyes,\\r\\neh? and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth ­and\\r\\nthen the shape of the whole is oval.”“Perhaps so,” said I;\\r\\n“but, Legrand, I fear you are no artist. \\r\\nI must wait until I see the beetle itself, if I am\\r\\nto form any idea of its personal appearance.”“Well, I don’t know,”\\r\\nsaid he, a little nettled, “I draw tolerably ­should\\r\\ndo it at least ­have had good masters, and\\r\\nflatter myself that I am not quite a blockhead.”“But, my dear fellow, you are\\r\\njoking then,” said I, “this is a very\\r\\npassable skull ­indeed, I may say that it\\r\\nis a very excellent skull, according to the vulgar\\r\\nnotions about such specimens of physiology ­and\\r\\nyour scarabÃ¦us must be the queerest scarabÃ¦us in\\r\\nthe world if it resembles it.  Why, we may get\\r\\nup a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this\\r\\nhint.  I presume you will call the bug scarabÃ¦us\\r\\ncaput hominis, or something of that kind ­there\\r\\nare many similar titles in the Natural Histories. \\r\\nBut where are the antennÃ¦ you spoke of?”“The antennÃ¦!” said Legrand,\\r\\nwho seemed to be getting unaccountably warm upon the\\r\\nsubject; “I am sure you must see the antennÃ¦. \\r\\nI made them as distinct as they are in the original\\r\\ninsect, and I presume that is sufficient.”“Well, well,” I said,\\r\\n“perhaps you have ­still I don’t\\r\\nsee them;” and I handed him the paper without\\r\\nadditional remark, not wishing to ruffle his temper;\\r\\nbut I was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken;\\r\\nhis ill humor puzzled me ­and, as for the\\r\\ndrawing of the beetle, there were positively no antennÃ¦\\r\\nvisible, and the whole did bear a very close resemblance\\r\\nto the ordinary cuts of a death’s-head.He received the paper very peevishly,\\r\\nand was about to crumple it, apparently to throw it\\r\\nin the fire, when a casual glance at the design seemed\\r\\nsuddenly to rivet his attention.  In an instant\\r\\nhis face grew violently red ­in another\\r\\nas excessively pale.  For some minutes he continued\\r\\nto scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat. \\r\\nAt length he arose, took a candle from the table,\\r\\nand proceeded to seat himself upon a sea-chest in\\r\\nthe farthest corner of the room.  Here again he\\r\\nmade an anxious examination of the paper; turning\\r\\nit in all directions.  He said nothing, however,\\r\\nand his conduct greatly astonished me; yet I thought\\r\\nit prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness\\r\\nof his temper by any comment.  Presently he took\\r\\nfrom his coat pocket a wallet, placed the paper carefully\\r\\nin it, and deposited both in a writing-desk, which\\r\\nhe locked.  He now grew more composed in his demeanor;\\r\\nbut his original air of enthusiasm had quite disappeared. \\r\\nYet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted. \\r\\nAs the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed\\r\\nin reverie, from which no sallies of mine could arouse\\r\\nhim.  It had been my intention to pass the night\\r\\nat the hut, as I had frequently done before, but,\\r\\nseeing my host in this mood, I deemed it proper to\\r\\ntake leave.  He did not press me to remain, but,\\r\\nas I departed, he shook my hand with even more than\\r\\nhis usual cordiality.It was about a month after this (and\\r\\nduring the interval I had seen nothing of Legrand)\\r\\nwhen I received a visit, at Charleston, from his man,\\r\\nJupiter.  I had never seen the good old negro look\\r\\nso dispirited, and I feared that some serious disaster\\r\\nhad befallen my friend.“Well, Jup,” said I, “what\\r\\nis the matter now? ­how is your master?”“Why, to speak de troof, massa,\\r\\nhim not so berry well as mought be.”“Not well!  I am truly sorry\\r\\nto hear it.  What does he complain of?”“Dar! dat’s it! ­him\\r\\nneber plain of notin ­but him berry sick\\r\\nfor all dat.”“Very sick, Jupiter! ­why\\r\\ndidn’t you say so at once?  Is he confined\\r\\nto bed?”“No, dat he aint! ­he\\r\\naint find nowhar ­dat’s just whar de\\r\\nshoe pinch ­my mind is got to be berry hebby\\r\\nbout poor Massa Will.”“Jupiter, I should like to understand\\r\\nwhat it is you are talking about.  You say your\\r\\nmaster is sick.  Hasn’t he told you what\\r\\nails him?”“Why, massa, taint worf while\\r\\nfor to git mad about de matter ­Massa Will\\r\\nsay noffin at all aint de matter wid him ­but\\r\\nden what make him go about looking dis here\\r\\nway, wid he head down and he soldiers up, and as white\\r\\nas a gose?  And den he keep a syphon all de time ­”“Keeps a what, Jupiter?”“Keeps a syphon wid de figgurs\\r\\non de slate ­de queerest figgurs I ebber\\r\\ndid see.  Ise gittin to be skeered, I tell you. \\r\\nHab for to keep mighty tight eye pon him noovers. \\r\\nTodder day he gib me slip fore de sun up and was gone\\r\\nde whole ob de blessed day.  I had a\\r\\nbig stick ready cut for to gib him deuced good beating\\r\\nwhen he did come ­but Ise sich a fool\\r\\ndat I hadn’t de heart arter all ­he\\r\\nlook so berry poorly.”“Eh? ­what? ­ah\\r\\nyes! ­upon the whole I think you had better\\r\\nnot be too severe with the poor fellow ­don’t\\r\\nflog him, Jupiter ­he can’t very well\\r\\nstand it ­but can you form no idea of what\\r\\nhas occasioned this illness, or rather this change\\r\\nof conduct?  Has anything unpleasant happened since\\r\\nI saw you?”“No, massa, dey aint bin noffin\\r\\nunpleasant since den ­’twas fore den\\r\\nI’m feared ­’twas de berry day\\r\\nyou was dare.”“How? what do you mean?”“Why, massa, I mean de bug ­dare now.”“The what?”“De bug, ­I’m\\r\\nberry sartain dat Massa Will bin bit somewhere bout\\r\\nde head by dat goole-bug.”“And what cause have you, Jupiter, for such\\r\\na supposition?”“Claws enuff, massa, and mouth\\r\\ntoo.  I nebber did see sick a deuced bug ­he\\r\\nkick and he bite ebery ting what cum near him. \\r\\nMassa Will cotch him fuss, but had for to let him\\r\\ngo gin mighty quick, I tell you ­den was\\r\\nde time he must ha got de bite.  I did n’t\\r\\nlike de look oh de bug mouff, myself, no how, so I\\r\\nwould n’t take hold ob him wid my finger,\\r\\nbut I cotch him wid a piece ob paper dat I found. \\r\\nI rap him up in de paper and stuff piece ob it\\r\\nin he mouff ­dat was de way.”“And you think, then, that your\\r\\nmaster was really bitten by the beetle, and that the\\r\\nbite made him sick?”“I do n’t tink noffin\\r\\nabout it ­I nose it.  What make him dream\\r\\nbout de goole so much, if taint cause he bit by de\\r\\ngoole-bug?  Ise heerd bout dem goole-bugs\\r\\nfore dis.”“But how do you know he dreams about gold?”“How I know? why cause he talk about it in he\\r\\nsleep ­dat’s how I nose.”“Well, Jup, perhaps you are\\r\\nright; but to what fortunate circumstance am I to\\r\\nattribute the honor of a visit from you to-day?”“What de matter, massa?”“Did you bring any message from Mr. Legrand?”“No, massa, I bring dis\\r\\nhere pissel;” and here Jupiter handed me\\r\\na note which ran thus:     MY DEAR   ­Why have I not seen you for so long\\r\\na time?  I hope you have not been so foolish as\\r\\nto take offence at any little brusquerie of\\r\\nmine; but no, that is improbable.  Since I saw\\r\\nyou I have had great cause for anxiety.  I have\\r\\nsomething to tell you, yet scarcely know how to tell\\r\\nit, or whether I should tell it at all.I have not been quite well for some\\r\\ndays past, and poor old Jup annoys me, almost beyond\\r\\nendurance, by his well-meant attentions Would you\\r\\nbelieve it? ­he had prepared a huge stick,\\r\\nthe other day, with which to chastise me for giving\\r\\nhim the slip, and spending the day, solus,\\r\\namong the hills on the main land.  I verily believe\\r\\nthat my ill looks alone saved me a flogging.I have made no addition to my cabinet since we met.If you can, in any way, make it convenient,\\r\\ncome over with Jupiter. Do come.  I wish\\r\\nto see you to-night, upon business of importance. \\r\\nI assure you that it is of the highest importance.        Ever\\r\\nyours,                     WILLIAM LEGRAND.There was something in the tone of\\r\\nthis note which gave me great uneasiness.  Its\\r\\nwhole style differed materially from that of Legrand. \\r\\nWhat could he be dreaming of?  What new crotchet\\r\\npossessed his excitable brain?  What “business\\r\\nof the highest importance” could he possibly\\r\\nhave to transact?  Jupiter’s account of\\r\\nhim boded no good.  I dreaded lest the continued\\r\\npressure of misfortune had, at length, fairly unsettled\\r\\nthe reason of my friend.  Without a moment’s\\r\\nhesitation, therefore, I prepared to accompany the\\r\\nnegro.Upon reaching the wharf, I noticed\\r\\na scythe and three spades, all apparently new, lying\\r\\nin the bottom of the boat in which we were to embark.“What is the meaning of all this, Jup?”\\r\\nI inquired.“Him syfe, massa, and spade.”“Very true; but what are they doing here?”“Him de syfe and de spade what\\r\\nMassa Will sis pon my buying for him in de town, and\\r\\nde debbils own lot of money I had to gib for em.”“But what, in the name of all\\r\\nthat is mysterious, is your ‘Massa Will’\\r\\ngoing to do with scythes and spades?”“Dat’s more dan I\\r\\nknow, and debbil take me if I don’t blieve ’tis\\r\\nmore dan he know, too.  But it’s all\\r\\ncum ob do bug.”Finding that no satisfaction was to\\r\\nbe obtained of Jupiter, whose whole intellect seemed\\r\\nto be absorbed by “de bug,” I now stepped\\r\\ninto the boat and made sail.  With a fair and\\r\\nstrong breeze we soon ran into the little cove to\\r\\nthe northward of Fort Moultrie, and a walk of some\\r\\ntwo miles brought us to the hut.  It was about\\r\\nthree in the afternoon when we arrived.  Legrand\\r\\nhad been awaiting us in eager expectation.  He\\r\\ngrasped my hand with a nervous empressement which\\r\\nalarmed me and strengthened the suspicions already\\r\\nentertained.  His countenance was pale even to\\r\\nghastliness, and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural\\r\\nlustre.  After some inquiries respecting his health,\\r\\nI asked him, not knowing what better to say, if he\\r\\nhad yet obtained the scarabÃ¦us from Lieutenant G\\r\\n  .“Oh, yes,” he replied,\\r\\ncoloring violently, “I got it from him the next\\r\\nmorning.  Nothing should tempt me to part with\\r\\nthat scarabÃ¦us.  Do you know that Jupiter is\\r\\nquite right about it?”“In what way?” I asked, with a sad foreboding\\r\\nat heart.“In supposing it to be a bug\\r\\nof real gold.”  He said this with an air\\r\\nof profound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly\\r\\nshocked.“This bug is to make my fortune,”\\r\\nhe continued, with a triumphant smile, “to reinstate\\r\\nme in my family possessions.  Is it any wonder,\\r\\nthen, that I prize it?  Since Fortune has thought\\r\\nfit to bestow it upon me, I have only to use it properly\\r\\nand I shall arrive at the gold of which it is the\\r\\nindex.  Jupiter; bring me that scarabÃ¦us!”“What! de bug, massa?  I’d\\r\\nrudder not go fer trubble dat bug ­you\\r\\nmus git him for your own self.” \\r\\nHereupon Legrand arose, with a grave and stately air,\\r\\nand brought me the beetle from a glass case in which\\r\\nit was enclosed.  It was a beautiful scarabÃ¦us,\\r\\nand, at that time, unknown to naturalists ­of\\r\\ncourse a great prize in a scientific point of view. \\r\\nThere were two round, black spots near one extremity\\r\\nof the back, and a long one near the other.  The\\r\\nscales were exceedingly hard and glossy, with all\\r\\nthe appearance of burnished gold.  The weight of\\r\\nthe insect was very remarkable, and, taking all things\\r\\ninto consideration, I could hardly blame Jupiter for\\r\\nhis opinion respecting it; but what to make of Legrand’s\\r\\nconcordance with that opinion, I could not, for the\\r\\nlife of me, tell.“I sent for you,” said\\r\\nhe, in a grandiloquent tone, when I had completed\\r\\nmy examination of the beetle, “I sent for you,\\r\\nthat I might have your counsel and assistance in furthering\\r\\nthe views of Fate and of the bug” ­“My dear Legrand,” I cried,\\r\\ninterrupting him, “you are certainly unwell,\\r\\nand had better use some little precautions.  You\\r\\nshall go to bed, and I will remain with you a few\\r\\ndays, until you get over this.  You are feverish\\r\\nand” ­“Feel my pulse,” said he.I felt it, and, to say the truth,\\r\\nfound not the slightest indication of fever.“But you may be ill and yet\\r\\nhave no fever.  Allow me this once to prescribe\\r\\nfor you.  In the first place, go to bed.  In\\r\\nthe next” ­“You are mistaken,” he\\r\\ninterposed, “I am as well as I can expect to\\r\\nbe under the excitement which I suffer.  If you\\r\\nreally wish me well, you will relieve this excitement.”“And how is this to be done?”“Very easily.  Jupiter and\\r\\nmyself are going upon an expedition into the hills,\\r\\nupon the main land, and, in this expedition we shall\\r\\nneed the aid of some person in whom we can confide. \\r\\nYou are the only one we can trust.  Whether we\\r\\nsucceed or fail, the excitement which you now perceive\\r\\nin me will be equally allayed.”“I am anxious to oblige you\\r\\nin any way,” I replied; “but do you mean\\r\\nto say that this infernal beetle has any connection\\r\\nwith your expedition into the hills?”“It has.”“Then, Legrand, I can become a party to no such\\r\\nabsurd proceeding.”“I am sorry ­very sorry ­for\\r\\nwe shall have to try it by ourselves.”“Try it by yourselves! \\r\\nThe man is surely mad! ­but stay! ­how\\r\\nlong do you propose to be absent?”“Probably all night.  We\\r\\nshall start immediately, and be back, at all events,\\r\\nby sunrise.”“And will you promise me, upon\\r\\nyour honor, that when this freak of yours is over,\\r\\nand the bug business (good God!) settled to your satisfaction,\\r\\nyou will then return home and follow my advice implicitly,\\r\\nas that of your physician?”“Yes; I promise; and now let\\r\\nus be off, for we have no time to lose.”With a heavy heart I accompanied my\\r\\nfriend.  We started about four o’clock ­Legrand,\\r\\nJupiter, the dog, and myself.  Jupiter had with\\r\\nhim the scythe and spades ­the whole of\\r\\nwhich he insisted upon carrying ­more through\\r\\nfear, it seemed to me, of trusting either of the implements\\r\\nwithin reach of his master, than from any excess of\\r\\nindustry or complaisance.  His demeanor was dogged\\r\\nin the extreme, and “dat deuced bug” were\\r\\nthe sole words which escaped his lips during the journey. \\r\\nFor my own part, I had charge of a couple of dark\\r\\nlanterns, while Legrand contented himself with the\\r\\nscarabÃ¦us, which he carried attached to the end of\\r\\na bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and fro, with the\\r\\nair of a conjuror, as he went.  When I observed\\r\\nthis last, plain evidence of my friend’s aberration\\r\\nof mind, I could scarcely refrain from tears. \\r\\nI thought it best, however, to humor his fancy, at\\r\\nleast for the present, or until I could adopt some\\r\\nmore energetic measures with a chance of success. \\r\\nIn the mean time I endeavored, but all in vain, to\\r\\nsound him in regard to the object of the expedition. \\r\\nHaving succeeded in inducing me to accompany him,\\r\\nhe seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any\\r\\ntopic of minor importance, and to all my questions\\r\\nvouchsafed no other reply than “we shall see!”We crossed the creek at the head of\\r\\nthe island by means of a skiff; and, ascending the\\r\\nhigh grounds on the shore of the main land, proceeded\\r\\nin a northwesterly direction, through a tract of country\\r\\nexcessively wild and desolate, where no trace of a\\r\\nhuman footstep was to be seen.  Legrand led the\\r\\nway with decision; pausing only for an instant, here\\r\\nand there, to consult what appeared to be certain\\r\\nlandmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion.In this manner we journeyed for about\\r\\ntwo hours, and the sun was just setting when we entered\\r\\na region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen. \\r\\nIt was a species of table land, near the summit of\\r\\nan almost inaccessible hill, densely wooded from base\\r\\nto pinnacle, and interspersed with huge crags that\\r\\nappeared to lie loosely upon the soil, and in many\\r\\ncases were prevented from precipitating themselves\\r\\ninto the valleys below, merely by the support of the\\r\\ntrees against which they reclined.  Deep ravines,\\r\\nin various directions, gave an air of still sterner\\r\\nsolemnity to the scene.The natural platform to which we had\\r\\nclambered was thickly overgrown with brambles, through\\r\\nwhich we soon discovered that it would have been impossible\\r\\nto force our way but for the scythe; and Jupiter, by\\r\\ndirection of his master, proceeded to clear for us\\r\\na path to the foot of an enormously tall tulip-tree,\\r\\nwhich stood, with some eight or ten oaks, upon the\\r\\nlevel, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees\\r\\nwhich I had then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage\\r\\nand form, in the wide spread of its branches, and\\r\\nin the general majesty of its appearance.  When\\r\\nwe reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and\\r\\nasked him if he thought he could climb it.  The\\r\\nold man seemed a little staggered by the question,\\r\\nand for some moments made no reply.  At length\\r\\nhe approached the huge trunk, walked slowly around\\r\\nit, and examined it with minute attention.  When\\r\\nhe had completed his scrutiny, he merely said,“Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he ebber see\\r\\nin he life.”“Then up with you as soon as\\r\\npossible, for it will soon be too dark to see what\\r\\nwe are about.”“How far mus go up, massa?”\\r\\ninquired Jupiter.“Get up the main trunk first,\\r\\nand then I will tell you which way to go ­and\\r\\nhere ­stop! take this beetle with you.”“De bug, Massa Will! ­de\\r\\ngoole bug!” cried the negro, drawing back in\\r\\ndismay ­“what for mus tote de\\r\\nbug way up de tree? ­d-n if I do!”“If you are afraid, Jup, a great\\r\\nbig negro like you, to take hold of a harmless little\\r\\ndead beetle, why you can carry it up by this string ­but,\\r\\nif you do not take it up with you in some way, I shall\\r\\nbe under the necessity of breaking your head with\\r\\nthis shovel.”“What de matter now, massa?”\\r\\nsaid Jup, evidently shamed into compliance; “always\\r\\nwant for to raise fuss wid old nigger.  Was only\\r\\nfunnin any how.  Me feered de bug! what I keer\\r\\nfor de bug?” Here he took cautiously hold of\\r\\nthe extreme end of the string, and, maintaining the\\r\\ninsect as far from his person as circumstances would\\r\\npermit, prepared to ascend the tree.In youth, the tulip-tree, or Liriodendron\\r\\nTulipferum, the most magnificent of American foresters,\\r\\nhas a trunk peculiarly smooth, and often rises to\\r\\na great height without lateral branches; but, in its\\r\\nriper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while\\r\\nmany short limbs make their appearance on the stem. \\r\\nThus the difficulty of ascension, in the present case,\\r\\nlay more in semblance than in reality.  Embracing\\r\\nthe huge cylinder, as closely as possible, with his\\r\\narms and knees, seizing with his hands some projections,\\r\\nand resting his naked toes upon others, Jupiter, after\\r\\none or two narrow escapes from falling, at length\\r\\nwriggled himself into the first great fork, and seemed\\r\\nto consider the whole business as virtually accomplished. \\r\\nThe risk of the achievement was, in fact, now over,\\r\\nalthough the climber was some sixty or seventy feet\\r\\nfrom the ground.“Which way mus go now, Massa Will?”\\r\\nhe asked.“Keep up the largest branch ­the\\r\\none on this side,” said Legrand.  The negro\\r\\nobeyed him promptly, and apparently with but little\\r\\ntrouble; ascending higher and higher, until no glimpse\\r\\nof his squat figure could be obtained through the\\r\\ndense foliage which enveloped it.  Presently his\\r\\nvoice was heard in a sort of halloo.“How much fudder is got for go?”“How high up are you?” asked Legrand.“Ebber so fur,” replied\\r\\nthe negro; “can see de sky fru de top ob\\r\\nde tree.”“Never mind the sky, but attend\\r\\nto what I say.  Look down the trunk and count\\r\\nthe limbs below you on this side.  How many limbs\\r\\nhave you passed?”“One, two, tree, four, fibe ­I\\r\\ndone pass fibe big limb, massa, pon dis\\r\\nside.”“Then go one limb higher.”In a few minutes the voice was heard\\r\\nagain, announcing that the seventh limb was attained.“Now, Jup,” cried Legrand,\\r\\nevidently much excited, “I want you to work\\r\\nyour way out upon that limb as far as you can. \\r\\nIf you see anything strange, let me know.” \\r\\nBy this time what little doubt I might have entertained\\r\\nof my poor friend’s insanity, was put finally\\r\\nat rest.  I had no alternative but to conclude\\r\\nhim stricken with lunacy, and I became seriously anxious\\r\\nabout getting him home.  While I was pondering\\r\\nupon what was best to be done, Jupiter’s voice\\r\\nwas again heard.“Mos feerd for to ventur pon\\r\\ndis limb berry far ­tis dead limb putty\\r\\nmuch all de way.”“Did you say it was a dead limb,\\r\\nJupiter?” cried Legrand in a quavering voice.“Yes, massa, him dead as de\\r\\ndoor-nail ­done up for sartain ­done\\r\\ndeparted dis here life.”“What in the name heaven shall\\r\\nI do?” asked Legrand, seemingly in the greatest\\r\\ndistress.  “Do!” said I, glad of an\\r\\nopportunity to interpose a word, “why come home\\r\\nand go to bed.  Come now! ­that’s\\r\\na fine fellow.  It’s getting late, and,\\r\\nbesides, you remember your promise.”“Jupiter,” cried he, without\\r\\nheeding me in the least, “do you hear me?”“Yes, Massa Will, hear you ebber so plain.”“Try the wood well, then, with\\r\\nyour knife, and see if you think it very rotten.”“Him rotten, massa, sure nuff,”\\r\\nreplied the negro in a few moments, “but not\\r\\nso berry rotten as mought be.  Mought ventur out\\r\\nleetle way pon de limb by myself, dat’s true.”“By yourself! ­what do you mean?”“Why I mean de bug.  ’Tis\\r\\nberry hebby bug.  Spose I drop him down fuss,\\r\\nand den de limb won’t break wid just de weight\\r\\nob one nigger.”“You infernal scoundrel!”\\r\\ncried Legrand, apparently much relieved, “what\\r\\ndo you mean by telling me such nonsense as that? \\r\\nAs sure as you drop that beetle I’ll break your\\r\\nneck.  Look here, Jupiter, do you hear me?”“Yes, massa, needn’t hollo at poor nigger\\r\\ndat style.”“Well! now listen! ­if\\r\\nyou will venture out on the limb as far as you think\\r\\nsafe, and not let go the beetle, I’ll make you\\r\\na present of a silver dollar as soon as you get down.”“I’m gwine, Massa Will ­deed\\r\\nI is,” replied the negro very promptly ­“mos\\r\\nout to the eend now.”“Out to the end!” here\\r\\nfairly screamed Legrand, “do you say you are\\r\\nout to the end of that limb?”“Soon be to de eend, massa, ­o-o-o-o-oh! \\r\\nLor-gol-a-marcy! what is dis here pon de\\r\\ntree?”“Well!” cried Legrand, highly delighted,\\r\\n“what is it?”“Why taint noffin but a skull ­somebody\\r\\nbin lef him head up de tree, and de crows done gobble\\r\\nebery bit ob de meat off.”“A skull, you say! ­very\\r\\nwell! ­how is it fastened to the limb? ­what\\r\\nholds it on?”“Sure nuff, massa; mus\\r\\nlook.  Why dis berry curous sarcumstance,\\r\\npon my word ­dare’s a great big nail\\r\\nin de skull, what fastens ob it on to de tree.”“Well now, Jupiter, do exactly\\r\\nas I tell you ­do you hear?”“Yes, massa.”“Pay attention, then! ­find the left\\r\\neye of the skull.”“Hum! hoo! dat’s good! why dare aint no\\r\\neye lef at all.”“Curse your stupidity! do you know your right\\r\\nhand from your left?”“Yes, I nose dat ­nose\\r\\nall bout dat ­tis my lef hand what I chops\\r\\nde wood wid.”“To be sure! you are left-handed;\\r\\nand your left eye is on the same side as your left\\r\\nhand.  Now, I suppose, you can find the left eye\\r\\nof the skull, or the place where the left eye has\\r\\nbeen.  Have you found it?”Here was a long pause.  At length the negro asked,“Is de lef eye of de skull pon\\r\\nde same side as de lef hand of de skull, too? ­cause\\r\\nde skull aint got not a bit ob a hand at all ­nebber\\r\\nmind!  I got de lef eye now ­here de\\r\\nlef eye! what mus do wid it?”“Let the beetle drop through\\r\\nit, as far as the string will reach ­but\\r\\nbe careful and not let go your hold of the string.”“All dat done, Massa Will; mighty\\r\\neasy ting for to put de bug fru de hole ­look\\r\\nout for him dare below!”During this colloquy no portion of\\r\\nJupiter’s person could be seen; but the beetle,\\r\\nwhich he had suffered to descend, was now visible at\\r\\nthe end of the string, and glistened, like a globe\\r\\nof burnished gold, in the last rays of the setting\\r\\nsun, some of which still faintly illumined the eminence\\r\\nupon which we stood.  The scarabÃ¦us hung quite\\r\\nclear of any branches, and, if allowed to fall, would\\r\\nhave fallen at our feet.  Legrand immediately\\r\\ntook the scythe, and cleared with it a circular space,\\r\\nthree or four yards in diameter, just beneath the insect,\\r\\nand, having accomplished this, ordered Jupiter to\\r\\nlet go the string and come down from the tree.Driving a peg, with great nicety,\\r\\ninto the ground, at the precise spot where the beetle\\r\\nfell, my friend now produced from his pocket a tape\\r\\nmeasure.  Fastening one end of this at that point\\r\\nof the trunk, of the tree which was nearest the peg,\\r\\nhe unrolled it till it reached the peg, and thence\\r\\nfarther unrolled it, in the direction already established\\r\\nby the two points of the tree and the peg, for the\\r\\ndistance of fifty feet ­Jupiter clearing\\r\\naway the brambles with the scythe.  At the spot\\r\\nthus attained a second peg was driven, and about this,\\r\\nas a centre, a rude circle, about four feet in diameter,\\r\\ndescribed.  Taking now a spade himself, and giving\\r\\none to Jupiter and one to me, Legrand begged us to\\r\\nset about digging as quickly as possible.To speak the truth, I had no especial\\r\\nrelish for such amusement at any time, and, at that\\r\\nparticular moment, would most willingly have declined\\r\\nit; for the night was coming on, and I felt much fatigued\\r\\nwith the exercise already taken; but I saw no mode\\r\\nof escape, and was fearful of disturbing my poor friend’s\\r\\nequanimity by a refusal.  Could I have depended,\\r\\nindeed, upon Jupiter’s aid, I would have had\\r\\nno hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home\\r\\nby force; but I was too well assured of the old negro’s\\r\\ndisposition, to hope that he would assist me, under\\r\\nany circumstances, in a personal contest with his master. \\r\\nI made no doubt that the latter had been infected\\r\\nwith some of the innumerable Southern superstitions\\r\\nabout money buried, and that his phantasy had received\\r\\nconfirmation by the finding of the scarabÃ¦us, or,\\r\\nperhaps, by Jupiter’s obstinacy in maintaining\\r\\nit to be “a bug of real gold.”  A\\r\\nmind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by\\r\\nsuch suggestions ­especially if chiming\\r\\nin with favorite preconceived ideas ­and\\r\\nthen I called to mind the poor fellow’s speech\\r\\nabout the beetle’s being “the index of\\r\\nhis fortune.”  Upon the whole, I was sadly\\r\\nvexed and puzzled, but, at length, I concluded to make\\r\\na virtue of necessity ­to dig with a good\\r\\nwill, and thus the sooner to convince the visionary,\\r\\nby ocular demonstration, of the fallacy of the opinions\\r\\nhe entertained.The lanterns having been lit, we all\\r\\nfell to work with a zeal worthy a more rational cause;\\r\\nand, as the glare fell upon our persons and implements,\\r\\nI could not help thinking how picturesque a group we\\r\\ncomposed, and how strange and suspicious our labors\\r\\nmust have appeared to any interloper who, by chance,\\r\\nmight have stumbled upon our whereabouts.We dug very steadily for two hours. \\r\\nLittle was said; and our chief embarrassment lay in\\r\\nthe yelpings of the dog, who took exceeding interest\\r\\nin our proceedings.  He, at length, became so obstreperous\\r\\nthat we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some\\r\\nstragglers in the vicinity; ­or, rather,\\r\\nthis was the apprehension of Legrand; ­for\\r\\nmyself, I should have rejoiced at any interruption\\r\\nwhich might have enabled me to get the wanderer home. \\r\\nThe noise was, at length, very effectually silenced\\r\\nby Jupiter, who, getting out of the hole with a dogged\\r\\nair of deliberation, tied the brute’s mouth up\\r\\nwith one of his suspenders, and then returned, with\\r\\na grave chuckle, to his task.When the time mentioned had expired,\\r\\nwe had reached a depth of five feet, and yet no signs\\r\\nof any treasure became manifest.  A general pause\\r\\nensued, and I began to hope that the farce was at an\\r\\nend.  Legrand, however, although evidently much\\r\\ndisconcerted, wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced. \\r\\nWe had excavated the entire circle of four feet diameter,\\r\\nand now we slightly enlarged the limit, and went to\\r\\nthe farther depth of two feet.  Still nothing\\r\\nappeared.  The gold-seeker, whom I sincerely pitied,\\r\\nat length clambered from the pit, with the bitterest\\r\\ndisappointment imprinted upon every feature, and proceeded,\\r\\nslowly and reluctantly, to put on his coat, which\\r\\nhe had thrown off at the beginning of his labor. \\r\\nIn the mean time I made no remark.  Jupiter, at\\r\\na signal from his master, began to gather up his tools. \\r\\nThis done, and the dog having been unmuzzled, we turned\\r\\nin profound silence towards home.We had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps\\r\\nin this direction, when, with a loud oath, Legrand\\r\\nstrode up to Jupiter, and seized him by the collar. \\r\\nThe astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the\\r\\nfullest extent, let fall the spades, and fell upon\\r\\nhis knees.“You scoundrel,” said\\r\\nLegrand, hissing out the syllables from between his\\r\\nclenched teeth ­“you infernal black\\r\\nvillain! ­speak, I tell you! ­answer\\r\\nme this instant, without prevarication! ­which ­which\\r\\nis your left eye?”“Oh, my golly, Massa Will! aint\\r\\ndis here my lef eye for sartain?” roared\\r\\nthe terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his right\\r\\norgan of vision, and holding it there with a desperate\\r\\npertinacity, as if in immediate dread of his master’s\\r\\nattempt at a gouge.“I thought so! ­I\\r\\nknew it! hurrah!” vociferated Legrand, letting\\r\\nthe negro go, and executing a series of curvets and\\r\\ncaracols, much to the astonishment of his valet, who,\\r\\narising from his knees, looked, mutely, from his master\\r\\nto myself, and then from myself to his master.“Come! we must go back,”\\r\\nsaid the latter, “the game’s not up yet;”\\r\\nand he again led the way to the tulip-tree.“Jupiter,” said he, when\\r\\nwe reached its foot, “come here! was the skull\\r\\nnailed to the limb with the face outwards, or with\\r\\nthe face to the limb?”“De face was out, massa, so\\r\\ndat de crows could get at de eyes good, widout any\\r\\ntrouble.”“Well, then, was it this eye\\r\\nor that through which you dropped the beetle?” ­here\\r\\nLegrand touched each of Jupiter’s eyes.“Twas dis eye, massa ­de\\r\\nlef eye ­jis as you tell me,” and here\\r\\nit was his right eye that the negro indicated.“That will do ­must try it again.”Here my friend, about whose madness\\r\\nI now saw, or fancied that I saw, certain indications\\r\\nof method, removed the peg which marked the spot where\\r\\nthe beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to the\\r\\nwestward of its former position.  Taking, now,\\r\\nthe tape measure from the nearest point of the trunk\\r\\nto the peg, as before, and continuing the extension\\r\\nin a straight line to the distance of fifty feet, a\\r\\nspot was indicated, removed, by several yards, from\\r\\nthe point at which we had been digging.Around the new position a circle,\\r\\nsomewhat larger than in the former instance, was now\\r\\ndescribed, and we again set to work with the spades. \\r\\nI was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding\\r\\nwhat had occasioned the change in my thoughts, I felt\\r\\nno longer any great aversion from the labor imposed. \\r\\nI had become most unaccountably interested ­nay,\\r\\neven excited.  Perhaps there was something, amid\\r\\nall the extravagant demeanor of Legrand ­some\\r\\nair of forethought, or of deliberation, which impressed\\r\\nme.  I dug eagerly, and now and then caught myself\\r\\nactually looking, with something that very much resembled\\r\\nexpectation, for the fancied treasure, the vision\\r\\nof which had demented my unfortunate companion. \\r\\nAt a period when such vagaries of thought most fully\\r\\npossessed me, and when we had been at work perhaps\\r\\nan hour and a half, we were again interrupted by the\\r\\nviolent howlings of the dog.  His uneasiness, in\\r\\nthe first instance, had been, evidently, but the result\\r\\nof playfulness or caprice, but he now assumed a bitter\\r\\nand serious tone.  Upon Jupiter’s again\\r\\nattempting to muzzle him, he made furious resistance,\\r\\nand, leaping into the hole, tore up the mould frantically\\r\\nwith his claws.  In a few seconds he had uncovered\\r\\na mass of human bones, forming two complete skeletons,\\r\\nintermingled with several buttons of metal, and what\\r\\nappeared to be the dust of decayed woollen.  One\\r\\nor two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a\\r\\nlarge Spanish knife, and, as we dug farther, three\\r\\nor four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to\\r\\nlight.At sight of these the joy of Jupiter\\r\\ncould scarcely be restrained, but the countenance\\r\\nof his master wore an air of extreme disappointment\\r\\nHe urged us, however, to continue our exertions, and\\r\\nthe words were hardly uttered when I stumbled and\\r\\nfell forward, having caught the toe of my boot in\\r\\na large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose\\r\\nearth.We now worked in earnest, and never\\r\\ndid I pass ten minutes of more intense excitement. \\r\\nDuring this interval we had fairly unearthed an oblong\\r\\nchest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation\\r\\nand wonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected\\r\\nto some mineralizing process ­perhaps that\\r\\nof the Bi-chloride of Mercury.  This box was three\\r\\nfeet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and\\r\\na half feet deep.  It was firmly secured by bands\\r\\nof wrought iron, riveted, and forming a kind of open\\r\\ntrelliswork over the whole.  On each side of the\\r\\nchest, near the top, were three rings of iron ­six\\r\\nin all ­by means of which a firm hold could\\r\\nbe obtained by six persons.  Our utmost united\\r\\nendeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly\\r\\nin its bed.  We at once saw the impossibility\\r\\nof removing so great a weight.  Luckily, the sole\\r\\nfastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts. \\r\\nThese we drew back ­trembling and panting\\r\\nwith anxiety.  In an instant, a treasure of incalculable\\r\\nvalue lay gleaming before us.  As the rays of the\\r\\nlanterns fell within the pit, there flashed upwards\\r\\na glow and a glare, from a confused heap of gold and\\r\\nof jewels, that absolutely dazzled our eyes.I shall not pretend to describe the\\r\\nfeelings with which I gazed.  Amazement was, of\\r\\ncourse, predominant.  Legrand appeared exhausted\\r\\nwith excitement, and spoke very few words.  Jupiter’s\\r\\ncountenance wore, for some minutes, as deadly a pallor\\r\\nas it is possible, in nature of things, for any negro’s\\r\\nvisage to assume.  He seemed stupified ­thunderstricken. \\r\\nPresently he fell upon his knees in the pit, and, burying\\r\\nhis naked arms up to the elbows in gold, let them\\r\\nthere remain, as if enjoying the luxury of a bath. \\r\\nAt length, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in\\r\\na soliloquy,“And dis all cum ob\\r\\nde goole-bug! de putty goole bug! de poor little\\r\\ngoole-bug, what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob\\r\\nstyle!  Aint you shamed ob yourself, nigger? ­answer\\r\\nme dat!”It became necessary, at last, that\\r\\nI should arouse both master and valet to the expediency\\r\\nof removing the treasure.  It was growing late,\\r\\nand it behooved us to make exertion, that we might\\r\\nget every thing housed before daylight.  It was\\r\\ndifficult to say what should be done, and much time\\r\\nwas spent in deliberation ­so confused were\\r\\nthe ideas of all.  We, finally, lightened the\\r\\nbox by removing two thirds of its contents, when we\\r\\nwere enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from the\\r\\nhole.  The articles taken out were deposited among\\r\\nthe brambles, and the dog left to guard them, with\\r\\nstrict orders from Jupiter neither, upon any pretence,\\r\\nto stir from the spot, nor to open his mouth until\\r\\nour return.  We then hurriedly made for home with\\r\\nthe chest; reaching the hut in safety, but after excessive\\r\\ntoil, at one o’clock in the morning.  Worn\\r\\nout as we were, it was not in human nature to do more\\r\\nimmediately.  We rested until two, and had supper;\\r\\nstarting for the hills immediately afterwards, armed\\r\\nwith three stout sacks, which, by good luck, were upon\\r\\nthe premises.  A little before four we arrived\\r\\nat the pit, divided the remainder of the booty, as\\r\\nequally as might be, among us, and, leaving the holes\\r\\nunfilled, again set out for the hut, at which, for\\r\\nthe second time, we deposited our golden burthens,\\r\\njust as the first faint streaks of the dawn gleamed\\r\\nfrom over the tree-tops in the East.We were now thoroughly broken down;\\r\\nbut the intense excitement of the time denied us repose. \\r\\nAfter an unquiet slumber of some three or four hours’\\r\\nduration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination\\r\\nof our treasure.The chest had been full to the brim,\\r\\nand we spent the whole day, and the greater part of\\r\\nthe next night, in a scrutiny of its contents. \\r\\nThere had been nothing like order or arrangement. \\r\\nEvery thing had been heaped in promiscuously. \\r\\nHaving assorted all with care, we found ourselves\\r\\npossessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first\\r\\nsupposed.  In coin there was rather more than\\r\\nfour hundred and fifty thousand dollars ­estimating\\r\\nthe value of the pieces, as accurately as we could,\\r\\nby the tables of the period.  There was not a particle\\r\\nof silver.  All was gold of antique date and of\\r\\ngreat variety ­French, Spanish, and German\\r\\nmoney, with a few English guineas, and some counters,\\r\\nof which we had never seen specimens before. \\r\\nThere were several very large and heavy coins, so\\r\\nworn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions. \\r\\nThere was no American money.  The value of the\\r\\njewels we found more difficulty in estimating. \\r\\nThere were diamonds ­some of them exceedingly\\r\\nlarge and fine ­a hundred and ten in all,\\r\\nand not one of them small; eighteen rubies of remarkable\\r\\nbrilliancy; ­three hundred and ten emeralds,\\r\\nall very beautiful; and twenty-one sapphires, with\\r\\nan opal.  These stones had all been broken from\\r\\ntheir settings and thrown loose in the chest. \\r\\nThe settings themselves, which we picked out from\\r\\namong the other gold, appeared to have been beaten\\r\\nup with hammers, as if to prevent identification. \\r\\nBesides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid\\r\\ngold ornaments; ­nearly two hundred massive\\r\\nfinger and earrings; ­rich chains ­thirty\\r\\nof these, if I remember; ­eighty-three very\\r\\nlarge and heavy crucifixes; ­five gold censers\\r\\nof great value; ­a prodigious golden punch\\r\\nbowl, ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and\\r\\nBacchanalian figures; with two sword-handles exquisitely\\r\\nembossed, and many other smaller articles which I\\r\\ncannot recollect.  The weight of these valuables\\r\\nexceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois;\\r\\nand in this estimate I have not included one hundred\\r\\nand ninety-seven superb gold watches; three of the\\r\\nnumber being worth each five hundred dollars, if one. \\r\\nMany of them were very old, and as time keepers valueless;\\r\\nthe works having suffered, more or less, from corrosion ­but\\r\\nall were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth. \\r\\nWe estimated the entire contents of the chest, that\\r\\nnight, at a million and a half of dollars; and upon\\r\\nthe subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels\\r\\n(a few being retained for our own use), it was found\\r\\nthat we had greatly undervalued the treasure. \\r\\nWhen, at length, we had concluded our examination,\\r\\nand the intense excitement of the time had, in some\\r\\nmeasure, subsided, Legrand, who saw that I was dying\\r\\nwith impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary\\r\\nriddle, entered into a full detail of all the circumstances\\r\\nconnected with it.“You remember;” said he,\\r\\n“the night when I handed you the rough sketch\\r\\nI had made of the scarabÃ¦us.  You recollect also,\\r\\nthat I became quite vexed at you for insisting that\\r\\nmy drawing resembled a death’s-head.  When\\r\\nyou first made this assertion I thought you were jesting;\\r\\nbut afterwards I called to mind the peculiar spots\\r\\non the back of the insect, and admitted to myself\\r\\nthat your remark had some little foundation in fact. \\r\\nStill, the sneer at my graphic powers irritated me ­for\\r\\nI am considered a good artist ­and, therefore,\\r\\nwhen you handed me the scrap of parchment, I was about\\r\\nto crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire.”“The scrap of paper, you mean,” said I.“No; it had much of the appearance\\r\\nof paper, and at first I supposed it to be such, but\\r\\nwhen I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at once,\\r\\nto be a piece of very thin parchment.  It was quite\\r\\ndirty, you remember.  Well, as I was in the very\\r\\nact of crumpling it up, my glance fell upon the sketch\\r\\nat which you had been looking, and you may imagine\\r\\nmy astonishment when I perceived, in fact, the figure\\r\\nof a death’s-head just where, it seemed to me,\\r\\nI had made the drawing of the beetle.  For a moment\\r\\nI was too much amazed to think with accuracy. \\r\\nI knew that my design was very different in detail\\r\\nfrom this ­although there was a certain\\r\\nsimilarity in general outline.  Presently I took\\r\\na candle, and seating myself at the other end of the\\r\\nroom, proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely. \\r\\nUpon turning it over, I saw my own sketch upon the\\r\\nreverse, just as I had made it.  My first idea,\\r\\nnow, was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity\\r\\nof outline ­at the singular coincidence\\r\\ninvolved in the fact, that unknown to me, there should\\r\\nhave been a skull upon the other side of the parchment,\\r\\nimmediately beneath my figure of the scarabÃ¦us, and\\r\\nthat this skull, not only in outline, but in size,\\r\\nshould so closely resemble my drawing.  I say the\\r\\nsingularity of this coincidence absolutely stupified\\r\\nme for a time.  This is the usual effect of such\\r\\ncoincidences.  The mind struggles to establish\\r\\na connexion ­a sequence of cause and effect ­and,\\r\\nbeing unable to do so, suffers a species of temporary\\r\\nparalysis.  But, when I recovered from this stupor,\\r\\nthere dawned upon me gradually a conviction which\\r\\nstartled me even far more than the coincidence. \\r\\nI began distinctly, positively, to remember that there\\r\\nhad been no drawing upon the parchment when I made\\r\\nmy sketch of the scarabÃ¦us.  I became perfectly\\r\\ncertain of this; for I recollected turning up first\\r\\none side and then the other, in search of the cleanest\\r\\nspot.  Had the skull been then there, of course\\r\\nI could not have failed to notice it.  Here was\\r\\nindeed a mystery which I felt it impossible to explain;\\r\\nbut, even at that early moment, there seemed to glimmer,\\r\\nfaintly, within the most remote and secret chambers\\r\\nof my intellect, a glow-worm-like conception of that\\r\\ntruth which last night’s adventure brought to\\r\\nso magnificent a demonstration.  I arose at once,\\r\\nand putting the parchment securely away, dismissed\\r\\nall farther reflection until I should be alone.“When you had gone, and when\\r\\nJupiter was fast asleep, I betook myself to a more\\r\\nmethodical investigation of the affair.  In the\\r\\nfirst place I considered the manner in which the parchment\\r\\nhad come into my possession.  The spot where we\\r\\ndiscovered the scarabaeus was on the coast of the\\r\\nmain land, about a mile eastward of the island, and\\r\\nbut a short distance above high water mark.  Upon\\r\\nmy taking hold of it, it gave me a sharp bite, which\\r\\ncaused me to let it drop.  Jupiter, with his accustomed\\r\\ncaution, before seizing the insect, which had flown\\r\\ntowards him, looked about him for a leaf, or something\\r\\nof that nature, by which to take hold of it. \\r\\nIt was at this moment that his eyes, and mine also,\\r\\nfell upon the scrap of parchment, which I then supposed\\r\\nto be paper.  It was lying half buried in the\\r\\nsand, a corner sticking up.  Near the spot where\\r\\nwe found it, I observed the remnants of the hull of\\r\\nwhat appeared to have been a ship’s long boat. \\r\\nThe wreck seemed to have been there for a very great\\r\\nwhile; for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely\\r\\nbe traced.“Well, Jupiter picked up the\\r\\nparchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and gave it to\\r\\nme.  Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and\\r\\non the way met Lieutenant G-.  I showed him the\\r\\ninsect, and he begged me to let him take it to the\\r\\nfort.  Upon my consenting, he thrust it forthwith\\r\\ninto his waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in\\r\\nwhich it had been wrapped, and which I had continued\\r\\nto hold in my hand during his inspection.  Perhaps\\r\\nhe dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it best\\r\\nto make sure of the prize at once ­you know\\r\\nhow enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected with\\r\\nNatural History.  At the same time, without being\\r\\nconscious of it, I must have deposited the parchment\\r\\nin my own pocket.“You remember that when I went\\r\\nto the table, for the purpose of making a sketch of\\r\\nthe beetle, I found no paper where it was usually kept. \\r\\nI looked in the drawer, and found none there. \\r\\nI searched my pockets, hoping to find an old letter,\\r\\nwhen my hand fell upon the parchment.  I thus\\r\\ndetail the precise mode in which it came into my possession;\\r\\nfor the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force.“No doubt you will think me\\r\\nfanciful ­but I had already established a\\r\\nkind of connexion.  I had put together two links\\r\\nof a great chain.  There was a boat lying upon\\r\\na sea-coast, and not far from the boat was a parchment ­not\\r\\na paper ­with a skull depicted upon it. \\r\\nYou will, of course, ask ‘where is the connexion?’\\r\\nI reply that the skull, or death’s-head, is\\r\\nthe well-known emblem of the pirate.  The flag\\r\\nof the death’s head is hoisted in all engagements.“I have said that the scrap\\r\\nwas parchment, and not paper.  Parchment is durable ­almost\\r\\nimperishable.  Matters of little moment are rarely\\r\\nconsigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary\\r\\npurposes of drawing or writing, it is not nearly so\\r\\nwell adapted as paper.  This reflection suggested\\r\\nsome meaning ­some relevancy ­in\\r\\nthe death’s-head.  I did not fail to observe,\\r\\nalso, the form of the parchment.  Although one\\r\\nof its corners had been, by some accident, destroyed,\\r\\nit could be seen that the original form was oblong. \\r\\nIt was just such a slip, indeed, as might have been\\r\\nchosen for a memorandum ­for a record of\\r\\nsomething to be long remembered and carefully preserved.”“But,” I interposed, “you\\r\\nsay that the skull was not upon the parchment when\\r\\nyou made the drawing of the beetle.  How then do\\r\\nyou trace any connexion between the boat and the skull ­since\\r\\nthis latter, according to your own admission, must\\r\\nhave been designed (God only knows how or by whom)\\r\\nat some period subsequent to your sketching the scarabÃ¦us?”“Ah, hereupon turns the whole\\r\\nmystery; although the secret, at this point, I had\\r\\ncomparatively little difficulty in solving.  My\\r\\nsteps were sure, and could afford but a single result. \\r\\nI reasoned, for example, thus:  When I drew the\\r\\nscarabÃ¦us, there was no skull apparent upon the parchment. \\r\\nWhen I had completed the drawing I gave it to you,\\r\\nand observed you narrowly until you returned it. \\r\\nYou, therefore, did not design the skull, and no one\\r\\nelse was present to do it.  Then it was not done\\r\\nby human agency.  And nevertheless it was done.“At this stage of my reflections\\r\\nI endeavored to remember, and did remember, with entire\\r\\ndistinctness, every incident which occurred about\\r\\nthe period in question.  The weather was chilly\\r\\n(oh rare and happy accident!), and a fire was blazing\\r\\nupon the hearth.  I was heated with exercise and\\r\\nsat near the table.  You, however, had drawn a\\r\\nchair close to the chimney.  Just as I placed\\r\\nthe parchment in your hand, and as you were in the\\r\\nact of inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered,\\r\\nand leaped upon your shoulders.  With your left\\r\\nhand you caressed him and kept him off, while your\\r\\nright, holding the parchment, was permitted to fall\\r\\nlistlessly between your knees, and in close proximity\\r\\nto the fire.  At one moment I thought the blaze\\r\\nhad caught it, and was about to caution you, but,\\r\\nbefore I could speak, you had withdrawn it, and were\\r\\nengaged in its examination.  When I considered\\r\\nall these particulars, I doubted not for a moment\\r\\nthat heat had been the agent in bringing to light,\\r\\nupon the parchment, the skull which I saw designed\\r\\nupon it.  You are well aware that chemical preparations\\r\\nexist, and have existed time out of mind, by means\\r\\nof which it is possible to write upon either paper\\r\\nor vellum, so that the characters shall become visible\\r\\nonly when subjected to the action of fire.  Zaffre,\\r\\ndigested in aqua regia, and diluted with\\r\\nfour times its weight of water, is sometimes employed;\\r\\na green tint results.  The regulus of cobalt,\\r\\ndissolved in spirit of nitre, gives a red.  These\\r\\ncolors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after\\r\\nthe material written upon cools, but again become apparent\\r\\nupon the re-application of heat.“I now scrutinized the death’s-head\\r\\nwith care.  Its outer edges ­the edges\\r\\nof the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum ­were\\r\\nfar more distinct than the others.  It was clear\\r\\nthat the action of the caloric had been imperfect\\r\\nor unequal.  I immediately kindled a fire, and\\r\\nsubjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing\\r\\nheat.  At first, the only effect was the strengthening\\r\\nof the faint lines in the skull; but, upon persevering\\r\\nin the experiment, there became visible, at the corner\\r\\nof the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which\\r\\nthe death’s-head was delineated, the figure\\r\\nof what I at first supposed to be a goat.  A closer\\r\\nscrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was intended\\r\\nfor a kid.”“Ha! ha!” said I, “to\\r\\nbe sure I have no right to laugh at you ­a\\r\\nmillion and a half of money is too serious a matter\\r\\nfor mirth ­but you are not about to establish\\r\\na third link in your chain ­you will not\\r\\nfind any especial connexion between your pirates and\\r\\na goat ­pirates, you know, have nothing\\r\\nto do with goats; they appertain to the farming interest.”“But I have just said that the\\r\\nfigure was not that of a goat.”“Well, a kid then ­pretty much the\\r\\nsame thing.”“Pretty much, but not altogether,”\\r\\nsaid Legrand.  “You may have heard of one\\r\\nCaptain Kidd.  I at once looked upon the figure\\r\\nof the animal as a kind of punning or hieroglyphical\\r\\nsignature.  I say signature; because its position\\r\\nupon the vellum suggested this idea.  The death’s-head\\r\\nat the corner diagonally opposite, had, in the same\\r\\nmanner, the air of a stamp, or seal.  But I was\\r\\nsorely put out by the absence of all else ­of\\r\\nthe body to my imagined instrument ­of the\\r\\ntext for my context.”“I presume you expected to find\\r\\na letter between the stamp and the signature.”“Something of that kind. \\r\\nThe fact is, I felt irresistibly impressed with a\\r\\npresentiment of some vast good fortune impending. \\r\\nI can scarcely say why.  Perhaps, after all, it\\r\\nwas rather a desire than an actual belief; ­but\\r\\ndo you know that Jupiter’s silly words, about\\r\\nthe bug being of solid gold, had a remarkable effect\\r\\nupon my fancy?  And then the series of accidents\\r\\nand coincidences ­these were so very extraordinary. \\r\\nDo you observe how mere an accident it was that these\\r\\nevents should have occurred upon the sole day of all\\r\\nthe year in which it has been, or may be, sufficiently\\r\\ncool for fire, and that without the fire, or without\\r\\nthe intervention of the dog at the precise moment in\\r\\nwhich he appeared, I should never have become aware\\r\\nof the death’s-head, and so never the possessor\\r\\nof the treasure?”“But proceed ­I am all impatience.”“Well; you have heard, of course,\\r\\nthe many stories current ­the thousand vague\\r\\nrumors afloat about money buried, somewhere upon the\\r\\nAtlantic coast, by Kidd and his associates.  These\\r\\nrumors must have had some foundation in fact. \\r\\nAnd that the rumors have existed so long and so continuous,\\r\\ncould have resulted, it appeared to me, only from the\\r\\ncircumstance of the buried treasure still remaining\\r\\nentombed.  Had Kidd concealed his plunder for\\r\\na time, and afterwards reclaimed it, the rumors would\\r\\nscarcely have reached us in their present unvarying\\r\\nform.  You will observe that the stories told\\r\\nare all about money-seekers, not about money-finders. \\r\\nHad the pirate recovered his money, there the affair\\r\\nwould have dropped.  It seemed to me that some\\r\\naccident ­say the loss of a memorandum indicating\\r\\nits locality ­had deprived him of the means\\r\\nof recovering it, and that this accident had become\\r\\nknown to his followers, who otherwise might never\\r\\nhave heard that treasure had been concealed at all,\\r\\nand who, busying themselves in vain, because unguided\\r\\nattempts, to regain it, had given first birth, and\\r\\nthen universal currency, to the reports which are\\r\\nnow so common.  Have you ever heard of any important\\r\\ntreasure being unearthed along the coast?”“Never.”“But that Kidd’s accumulations\\r\\nwere immense, is well known.  I took it for granted,\\r\\ntherefore, that the earth still held them; and you\\r\\nwill scarcely be surprised when I tell you that I\\r\\nfelt a hope, nearly amounting to certainty, that the\\r\\nparchment so strangely found, involved a lost record\\r\\nof the place of deposit.”“But how did you proceed?”“I held the vellum again to\\r\\nthe fire, after increasing the heat; but nothing appeared. \\r\\nI now thought it possible that the coating of dirt\\r\\nmight have something to do with the failure; so I carefully\\r\\nrinsed the parchment by pouring warm water over it,\\r\\nand, having done this, I placed it in a tin pan, with\\r\\nthe skull downwards, and put the pan upon a furnace\\r\\nof lighted charcoal.  In a few minutes, the pan\\r\\nhaving become thoroughly heated, I removed the slip,\\r\\nand, to my inexpressible joy, found it spotted, in\\r\\nseveral places, with what appeared to be figures arranged\\r\\nin lines.  Again I placed it in the pan, and suffered\\r\\nit to remain another minute.  Upon taking it off,\\r\\nthe whole was just as you see it now.” \\r\\nHere Legrand, having re-heated the parchment, submitted\\r\\nit to my inspection.  The following characters\\r\\nwere rudely traced, in a red tint, between the death’s-head\\r\\nand the goat: “But,” said I, returning\\r\\nhim the slip, “I am as much in the dark as ever. \\r\\nWere all the jewels of Golconda awaiting me upon my\\r\\nsolution of this enigma, I am quite sure that I should\\r\\nbe unable to earn them.”“And yet,” said Legrand,\\r\\n“the solution is by no means so difficult as\\r\\nyou might be lead to imagine from the first hasty inspection\\r\\nof the characters.  These characters, as any one\\r\\nmight readily guess, form a cipher ­that\\r\\nis to say, they convey a meaning; but then, from what\\r\\nis known of Kidd, I could not suppose him capable\\r\\nof constructing any of the more abstruse cryptographs. \\r\\nI made up my mind, at once, that this was of a simple\\r\\nspecies ­such, however, as would appear,\\r\\nto the crude intellect of the sailor, absolutely insoluble\\r\\nwithout the key.”“And you really solved it?”“Readily; I have solved others\\r\\nof an abstruseness ten thousand times greater. \\r\\nCircumstances, and a certain bias of mind, have led\\r\\nme to take interest in such riddles, and it may well\\r\\nbe doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an\\r\\nenigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not,\\r\\nby proper application, resolve.  In fact, having\\r\\nonce established connected and legible characters,\\r\\nI scarcely gave a thought to the mere difficulty of\\r\\ndeveloping their import.“In the present case ­indeed\\r\\nin all cases of secret writing ­the first\\r\\nquestion regards the language of the cipher; for the\\r\\nprinciples of solution, so far, especially, as the\\r\\nmore simple ciphers are concerned, depend upon, and\\r\\nare varied by, the genius of the particular idiom. \\r\\nIn general, there is no alternative but experiment\\r\\n(directed by probabilities) of every tongue known\\r\\nto him who attempts the solution, until the true one\\r\\nbe attained.  But, with the cipher now before us,\\r\\nall difficulty was removed by the signature. \\r\\nThe pun upon the word ‘Kidd’ is appreciable\\r\\nin no other language than the English.  But for\\r\\nthis consideration I should have begun my attempts\\r\\nwith the Spanish and French, as the tongues in which\\r\\na secret of this kind would most naturally have been\\r\\nwritten by a pirate of the Spanish main.  As it\\r\\nwas, I assumed the cryptograph to be English.“You observe there are no divisions\\r\\nbetween the words.  Had there been divisions,\\r\\nthe task would have been comparatively easy.  In\\r\\nsuch case I should have commenced with a collation\\r\\nand analysis of the shorter words, and, had a word\\r\\nof a single letter occurred, as is most likely, (a\\r\\nor I, for example,) I should have considered the solution\\r\\nas assured.  But, there being no division, my\\r\\nfirst step was to ascertain the predominant letters,\\r\\nas well as the least frequent.  Counting all, I\\r\\nconstructed a table, thus: Of the character 8 there are 33.; \" 26.4 \" 19.\\u0087 ) \" 16. \" 13.5 \" 12.6 \" 11.\\u0086 1 \" 8.0 \" 6.9 2 \" 5.:  3 \" 4.? \" 3.¶ \" 2.“Now, in English, the letter\\r\\nwhich most frequently occurs is e.  Afterwards,\\r\\nsuccession runs thus:  a o i d h n r s t u y\\r\\nc f g l m w b k p q x z. E predominates\\r\\nso remarkably that an individual sentence of any length\\r\\nis rarely seen, in which it is not the prevailing character.“Here, then, we leave, in the\\r\\nvery beginning, the groundwork for something more\\r\\nthan a mere guess.  The general use which may be\\r\\nmade of the table is obvious ­but, in this\\r\\nparticular cipher, we shall only very partially require\\r\\nits aid.  As our predominant character is 8, we\\r\\nwill commence by assuming it as the e of the\\r\\nnatural alphabet.  To verify the supposition,\\r\\nlet us observe if the 8 be seen often in couples ­for\\r\\ne is doubled with great frequency in English ­in\\r\\nsuch words, for example, as ‘meet,’ ‘.fleet,’\\r\\n‘speed,’ ‘seen,’ been,’\\r\\n‘agree,’ &amp;c.  In the present instance\\r\\nwe see it doubled no less than five times, although\\r\\nthe cryptograph is brief.“Let us assume 8, then, as e. \\r\\nNow, of all words in the language, ‘the’\\r\\nis most usual; let us see, therefore, whether there\\r\\nare not repetitions of any three characters, in the\\r\\nsame order of collocation, the last of them being\\r\\n8.  If we discover repetitions of such letters,\\r\\nso arranged, they will most probably represent the\\r\\nword ‘the.’  Upon inspection, we find\\r\\nno less than seven such arrangements, the characters\\r\\nbeing;48.  We may, therefore, assume that; represents\\r\\nt, 4 represents h, and 8 represents\\r\\ne ­the last being now well confirmed. \\r\\nThus a great step has been taken.“But, having established a single\\r\\nword, we are enabled to establish a vastly important\\r\\npoint; that is to say, several commencements and terminations\\r\\nof other words.  Let us refer, for example, to\\r\\nthe last instance but one, in which the combination;48\\r\\noccurs ­not far from the end of the cipher. \\r\\nWe know that the; immediately ensuing is the commencement\\r\\nof a word, and, of the six characters succeeding this\\r\\n‘the,’ we are cognizant of no less than\\r\\nfive.  Let us set these characters down, thus,\\r\\nby the letters we know them to represent, leaving\\r\\na space for the unknown ­t eeth.“Here we are enabled, at once,\\r\\nto discard the ‘th,’ as forming no portion\\r\\nof the word commencing with the first t; since, by\\r\\nexperiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted\\r\\nto the vacancy, we perceive that no word can be formed\\r\\nof which this th can be a part.  We are\\r\\nthus narrowed intot ee,and, going through the alphabet, if\\r\\nnecessary, as before, we arrive at the word ‘tree,’\\r\\nas the sole possible reading.  We thus gain another\\r\\nletter, r, represented by (, with the words\\r\\n‘the tree’ in juxtaposition.“Looking beyond these words,\\r\\nfor a short distance, we again see the combination;48,\\r\\nand employ it by way of termination to what\\r\\nimmediately precedes.  We have thus this arrangement: the tree;4(Â\\u0087?34 the,or, substituting the natural letters,\\r\\nwhere known, it reads thus: the tree thrÂ\\u0087?3h the.“Now, if, in place of the unknown\\r\\ncharacters, we leave blank spaces, or substitute dots,\\r\\nwe read thus: the tree thr...h the,when the word ‘through’\\r\\nmakes itself evident at once.  But this discovery\\r\\ngives us three new letters, o, u and\\r\\ng, represented by Â\\u0087? and 3.“Looking now, narrowly, through\\r\\nthe cipher for combinations of known characters, we\\r\\nfind, not very far from the beginning, this arrangement,83(88, or egree,which, plainly, is the conclusion\\r\\nof the word ‘degree,’ and gives us another\\r\\nletter, d, represented by Â\\u0086.“Four letters beyond the word\\r\\n‘degree,’ we perceive the combination;46(;88.“Translating the known characters,\\r\\nand representing the unknown by dots, as before, we\\r\\nread thus:  th rtee. an arrangement immediately\\r\\nsuggestive of the word ‘thirteen,’ and\\r\\nagain furnishing us with two new characters, i\\r\\nand n, represented by 6 and .“Referring, now, to the beginning\\r\\nof the cryptograph, we find the combination,53Â\\u0087Â\\u0087Â\\u0086.“Translating, as before, we obtaingood,which assures us that the first letter\\r\\nis A, and that the first two words are ‘A\\r\\ngood.’“It is now time that we arrange\\r\\nour key, as far as discovered, in a tabular form,\\r\\nto avoid confusion.  It will stand thus: 5 represents      aÂ\\u0086       \"        \\r\\nd8       \"         e3       \"         g4       \"         h6       \"         i       \"         nÂ\\u0087       \"        \\r\\no(        \"        \\r\\nr;        \"         t“We have, therefore, no less\\r\\nthan ten of the most important letters represented,\\r\\nand it will be unnecessary to proceed with the details\\r\\nof the solution.  I have said enough to convince\\r\\nyou that ciphers of this nature are readily soluble,\\r\\nand to give you some insight into the rationale of\\r\\ntheir development.  But be assured that the specimen\\r\\nbefore us appertains to the very simplest species\\r\\nof cryptograph.  It now only remains to give you\\r\\nthe full translation of the characters upon the parchment,\\r\\nas unriddled.  Here it is: “’A good glass in the\\r\\nbishop’s hostel in the devil’s seat forty-one\\r\\ndegrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north\\r\\nmain branch seventh limb east side shoot from the\\r\\nleft eye of the death’s-head a bee line from\\r\\nthe tree through the shot fifty feet out.’”“But,” said I, “the\\r\\nenigma seems still in as bad a condition as ever. \\r\\nHow is it possible to extort a meaning from all this\\r\\njargon about ‘devil’s seats,’ ‘death’s\\r\\nheads,’ and ‘bishop’s hotels?’”“I confess,” replied Legrand,\\r\\n“that the matter still wears a serious aspect,\\r\\nwhen regarded with a casual glance.  My first endeavor\\r\\nwas to divide the sentence into the natural division\\r\\nintended by the cryptographist.”“You mean, to punctuate it?”“Something of that kind.”“But how was it possible to effect this?”“I reflected that it had been\\r\\na point with the writer to run his words together\\r\\nwithout division, so as to increase the difficulty\\r\\nof solution.  Now, a not over-acute man, in pursuing\\r\\nsuch an object would be nearly certain to overdo the\\r\\nmatter.  When, in the course of his composition,\\r\\nhe arrived at a break in his subject which would naturally\\r\\nrequire a pause, or a point, he would be exceedingly\\r\\napt to run his characters, at this place, more than\\r\\nusually close together.  If you will observe the\\r\\nMS., in the present instance, you will easily detect\\r\\nfive such cases of unusual crowding.  Acting upon\\r\\nthis hint, I made the division thus:  ’A\\r\\ngood glass in the Bishop’s hostel in the Devil’s\\r\\nseat ­forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes ­northeast\\r\\nand by north ­main branch seventh limb east\\r\\nside ­shoot from the left eye of the death’s-head ­a\\r\\nbee-line from the tree through the shot fifty feet\\r\\nout.’”“Even this division,” said I, “leaves\\r\\nme still in the dark.”“It left me also in the dark,”\\r\\nreplied Legrand, “for a few days; during which\\r\\nI made diligent inquiry, in the neighborhood of Sullivan’s\\r\\nIsland, for any building which went by the name of\\r\\nthe ‘Bishop’s Hotel;’ for, of course,\\r\\nI dropped the obsolete word ‘hostel.’ \\r\\nGaining no information on the subject, I was on the\\r\\npoint of extending my sphere of search, and proceeding\\r\\nin a more systematic manner, when, one morning, it\\r\\nentered into my head, quite suddenly, that this ‘Bishop’s\\r\\nHostel’ might have some reference to an old\\r\\nfamily, of the name of Bessop, which, time out of\\r\\nmind, had held possession of an ancient manor-house,\\r\\nabout four miles to the northward of the Island. \\r\\nI accordingly went over to the plantation, and re-instituted\\r\\nmy inquiries among the older negroes of the place. \\r\\nAt length one of the most aged of the women said that\\r\\nshe had heard of such a place as Bessop’s Castle,\\r\\nand thought that she could guide me to it, but that\\r\\nit was not a castle nor a tavern, but a high rock.“I offered to pay her well for\\r\\nher trouble, and, after some demur, she consented\\r\\nto accompany me to the spot.  We found it without\\r\\nmuch difficulty, when, dismissing her, I proceeded\\r\\nto examine the place.  The ‘castle’\\r\\nconsisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and\\r\\nrocks ­one of the latter being quite remarkable\\r\\nfor its height as well as for its insulated and artificial\\r\\nappearance I clambered to its apex, and then felt\\r\\nmuch at a loss as to what should be next done.“While I was busied in reflection,\\r\\nmy eyes fell upon a narrow ledge in the eastern face\\r\\nof the rock, perhaps a yard below the summit upon which\\r\\nI stood.  This ledge projected about eighteen inches,\\r\\nand was not more than a foot wide, while a niche in\\r\\nthe cliff just above it, gave it a rude resemblance\\r\\nto one of the hollow-backed chairs used by our ancestors. \\r\\nI made no doubt that here was the ‘devil’s\\r\\nseat’ alluded to in the MS., and now I seemed\\r\\nto grasp the full secret of the riddle.“The ‘good glass,’\\r\\nI knew, could have reference to nothing but a telescope;\\r\\nfor the word ‘glass’ is rarely employed\\r\\nin any other sense by seamen.  Now here, I at\\r\\nonce saw, was a telescope to be used, and a definite\\r\\npoint of view, admitting no variation, from which to\\r\\nuse it.  Nor did I hesitate to believe that the\\r\\nphrases, “forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes,’\\r\\nand ‘northeast and by north,’ were intended\\r\\nas directions for the levelling of the glass. \\r\\nGreatly excited by these discoveries, I hurried home,\\r\\nprocured a telescope, and returned to the rock.“I let myself down to the ledge,\\r\\nand found that it was impossible to retain a seat\\r\\nupon it except in one particular position.  This\\r\\nfact confirmed my preconceived idea.  I proceeded\\r\\nto use the glass.  Of course, the ‘forty-one\\r\\ndegrees and thirteen minutes’ could allude to\\r\\nnothing but elevation above the visible horizon, since\\r\\nthe horizontal direction was clearly indicated by\\r\\nthe words, ‘northeast and by north.’ \\r\\nThis latter direction I at once established by means\\r\\nof a pocket-compass; then, pointing the glass as nearly\\r\\nat an angle of forty-one degrees of elevation as I\\r\\ncould do it by guess, I moved it cautiously up or down,\\r\\nuntil my attention was arrested by a circular rift\\r\\nor opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtopped\\r\\nits fellows in the distance.  In the centre of\\r\\nthis rift I perceived a white spot, but could not,\\r\\nat first, distinguish what it was.  Adjusting\\r\\nthe focus of the telescope, I again looked, and now\\r\\nmade it out to be a human skull.“Upon this discovery I was so\\r\\nsanguine as to consider the enigma solved; for the\\r\\nphrase ‘main branch, seventh limb, east side,’\\r\\ncould refer only to the position of the skull upon\\r\\nthe tree, while ’shoot from the left eye of\\r\\nthe death’s head’ admitted, also, of but\\r\\none interpretation, in regard to a search for buried\\r\\ntreasure.  I perceived that the design was to\\r\\ndrop a bullet from the left eye of the skull, and that\\r\\na bee-line, or, in other words, a straight line, drawn\\r\\nfrom the nearest point of the trunk through ‘the\\r\\nshot,’ (or the spot where the bullet fell,) and\\r\\nthence extended to a distance of fifty feet, would\\r\\nindicate a definite point ­and beneath this\\r\\npoint I thought it at least possible that a deposit\\r\\nof value lay concealed.”“All this,” I said, “is\\r\\nexceedingly clear, and, although ingenious, still\\r\\nsimple and explicit.  When you left the Bishop’s\\r\\nHotel, what then?”“Why, having carefully taken\\r\\nthe bearings of the tree, I turned homewards. \\r\\nThe instant that I left ‘the devil’s seat,’\\r\\nhowever, the circular rift vanished; nor could I get\\r\\na glimpse of it afterwards, turn as I would. \\r\\nWhat seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole\\r\\nbusiness, is the fact (for repeated experiment has\\r\\nconvinced me it is a fact) that the circular opening\\r\\nin question is visible from no other attainable point\\r\\nof view than that afforded by the narrow ledge upon\\r\\nthe face of the rock.“In this expedition to the ‘Bishop’s\\r\\nHotel’ I had been attended by Jupiter, who had,\\r\\nno doubt, observed, for some weeks past, the abstraction\\r\\nof my demeanor, and took especial care not to leave\\r\\nme alone.  But, on the next day, getting up very\\r\\nearly, I contrived to give him the slip, and went\\r\\ninto the hills in search of the tree.  After much\\r\\ntoil I found it.  When I came home at night my\\r\\nvalet proposed to give me a flogging.  With the\\r\\nrest of the adventure I believe you are as well acquainted\\r\\nas myself.”“I suppose,” said I, “you\\r\\nmissed the spot, in the first attempt at digging,\\r\\nthrough Jupiter’s stupidity in letting the bug\\r\\nfall through the right instead of through the left\\r\\neye of the skull.”“Precisely.  This mistake\\r\\nmade a difference of about two inches and a half in\\r\\nthe ’shot’ ­that is to say, in\\r\\nthe position of the peg nearest the tree; and had\\r\\nthe treasure been beneath the ‘shot,’ the\\r\\nerror would have been of little moment; but ‘the\\r\\nshot,’ together with the nearest point of the\\r\\ntree, were merely two points for the establishment\\r\\nof a line of direction; of course the error, however\\r\\ntrivial in the beginning, increased as we proceeded\\r\\nwith the line, and by the time we had gone fifty feet,\\r\\nthrew us quite off the scent.  But for my deep-seated\\r\\nimpressions that treasure was here somewhere actually\\r\\nburied, we might have had all our labor in vain.”“But your grandiloquence, and\\r\\nyour conduct in swinging the beetle ­how\\r\\nexcessively odd!  I was sure you were mad. \\r\\nAnd why did you insist upon letting fall the bug,\\r\\ninstead of a bullet, from the skull?”“Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat\\r\\nannoyed by your evident suspicions touching my sanity,\\r\\nand so resolved to punish you quietly, in my own way,\\r\\nby a little bit of sober mystification.  For this\\r\\nreason I swung the beetle, and for this reason I let\\r\\nit fall it from the tree.  An observation of yours\\r\\nabout its great weight suggested the latter idea.”“Yes, I perceive; and now there\\r\\nis only one point which puzzles me.  What are\\r\\nwe to make of the skeletons found in the hole?”“That is a question I am no\\r\\nmore able to answer than yourself.  There seems,\\r\\nhowever, only one plausible way of accounting for them ­and\\r\\nyet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as\\r\\nmy suggestion would imply.  It is clear that Kidd ­if\\r\\nKidd indeed secreted this treasure, which I doubt\\r\\nnot ­it is clear that he must have had assistance\\r\\nin the labor.  But this labor concluded, he may\\r\\nhave thought it expedient to remove all participants\\r\\nin his secret.  Perhaps a couple of blows with\\r\\na mattock were sufficient, while his coadjutors were\\r\\nbusy in the pit; perhaps it required a dozen ­who\\r\\nshall tell?”'</span>"

       "[1] \"          What\\r\\nho! what ho! this fellow is dancing mad!He hath been bitten\\r\\nby the Tarantula._ ­All\\r\\nin the Wrong._MANY years ago, I contracted an intimacy\\r\\nwith a Mr. William Legrand.  He was of an ancient\\r\\nHuguenot family, and had once been wealthy; but a\\r\\nseries of misfortunes had reduced him to want. \\r\\nTo avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters,\\r\\nhe left New Orleans, the city of his forefathers,\\r\\nand took up his residence at Sullivans Island,\\r\\nnear Charleston, South Carolina.  This Island is\\r\\na very singular one.  It consists of little else\\r\\nthan the sea sand, and is about three miles long. \\r\\nIts breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile. \\r\\nIt is separated from the main land by a scarcely perceptible\\r\\ncreek, oozing its way through a wilderness of reeds\\r\\nand slime, a favorite resort of the marsh hen. \\r\\nThe vegetation, as might be supposed, is scant, or\\r\\nat least dwarfish.  No trees of any magnitude\\r\\nare to be seen.  Near the western extremity, where\\r\\nFort Moultrie stands, and where are some miserable\\r\\nframe buildings, tenanted, during summer, by the fugitives\\r\\nfrom Charleston dust and fever, may be found, indeed,\\r\\nthe bristly palmetto; but the whole island, with the\\r\\nexception of this western point, and a line of hard,\\r\\nwhite beach on the seacoast, is covered with a dense\\r\\nundergrowth of the sweet myrtle, so much prized by\\r\\nthe horticulturists of England.  The shrub here\\r\\noften attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet,\\r\\nand forms an almost impenetrable coppice, burthening\\r\\nthe air with its fragrance.In the inmost recesses of this coppice,\\r\\nnot far from the eastern or more remote end of the\\r\\nisland, Legrand had built himself a small hut, which\\r\\nhe occupied when I first, by mere accident, made his\\r\\nacquaintance.  This soon ripened into friendship ­for\\r\\nthere was much in the recluse to excite interest and\\r\\nesteem.  I found him well educated, with unusual\\r\\npowers of mind, but infected with misanthropy, and\\r\\nsubject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm\\r\\nand melancholy.  He had with him many books, but\\r\\nrarely employed them.  His chief amusements were\\r\\ngunning and fishing, or sauntering along the beach\\r\\nand through the myrtles, in quest of shells or entomological\\r\\nspecimens; ­his collection of the latter\\r\\nmight have been envied by a Swammerdamm.  In these\\r\\nexcursions he was usually accompanied by an old negro,\\r\\ncalled Jupiter, who had been manumitted before the\\r\\nreverses of the family, but who could be induced,\\r\\nneither by threats nor by promises, to abandon what\\r\\nhe considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps\\r\\nof his young Massa Will.  It is\\r\\nnot improbable that the relatives of Legrand, conceiving\\r\\nhim to be somewhat unsettled in intellect, had contrived\\r\\nto instil this obstinacy into Jupiter, with a view\\r\\nto the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer.The winters in the latitude of Sullivans\\r\\nIsland are seldom very severe, and in the fall of\\r\\nthe year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is\\r\\nconsidered necessary.  About the middle of October,\\r\\n18-, there occurred, however, a day of remarkable\\r\\nchilliness.  Just before sunset I scrambled my\\r\\nway through the evergreens to the hut of my friend,\\r\\nwhom I had not visited for several weeks ­my\\r\\nresidence being, at that time, in Charleston, a distance\\r\\nof nine miles from the Island, while the facilities\\r\\nof passage and re-passage were very far behind those\\r\\nof the present day.  Upon reaching the hut I rapped,\\r\\nas was my custom, and getting no reply, sought for\\r\\nthe key where I knew it was secreted, unlocked the\\r\\ndoor and went in.  A fine fire was blazing upon\\r\\nthe hearth.  It was a novelty, and by no means\\r\\nan ungrateful one.  I threw off an overcoat, took\\r\\nan arm-chair by the crackling logs, and awaited patiently\\r\\nthe arrival of my hosts.Soon after dark they arrived, and\\r\\ngave me a most cordial welcome.  Jupiter, grinning\\r\\nfrom ear to ear, bustled about to prepare some marsh-hens\\r\\nfor supper.  Legrand was in one of his fits ­how\\r\\nelse shall I term them? ­of enthusiasm. \\r\\nHe had found an unknown bivalve, forming a new genus,\\r\\nand, more than this, he had hunted down and secured,\\r\\nwith Jupiters assistance, a scarabÃ¦us which\\r\\nhe believed to be totally new, but in respect to which\\r\\nhe wished to have my opinion on the morrow.And why not to-night?\\r\\nI asked, rubbing my hands over the blaze, and wishing\\r\\nthe whole tribe of scarabÃ¦i at the devil.Ah, if I had only known you\\r\\nwere here! said Legrand, but its\\r\\nso long since I saw you; and how could I foresee that\\r\\nyou would pay me a visit this very night of all others? \\r\\nAs I was coming home I met Lieutenant G ­,\\r\\nfrom the fort, and, very foolishly, I lent him the\\r\\nbug; so it will be impossible for you to see it until\\r\\nthe morning.  Stay here to-night, and I will send\\r\\nJup down for it at sunrise.  It is the loveliest\\r\\nthing in creation!What? ­sunrise?Nonsense! no! ­the\\r\\nbug.  It is of a brilliant gold color ­about\\r\\nthe size of a large hickory-nut ­with two\\r\\njet black spots near one extremity of the back, and\\r\\nanother, somewhat longer, at the other.  The antennÃ¦\\r\\nare ­Dey aint no tin in him, Massa\\r\\nWill, I keep a tellin on you, here interrupted\\r\\nJupiter; de bug is a goole bug, solid, ebery\\r\\nbit of him, inside and all, sep him wing ­neber\\r\\nfeel half so hebby a bug in my life.Well, suppose it is, Jup,\\r\\nreplied Legrand, somewhat more earnestly, it seemed\\r\\nto me, than the case demanded, is that any reason\\r\\nfor your letting the birds burn?  The color ­here\\r\\nhe turned to me ­is really almost\\r\\nenough to warrant Jupiters idea.  You never\\r\\nsaw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales\\r\\nemit ­but of this you cannot judge till\\r\\ntomorrow.  In the mean time I can give you some\\r\\nidea of the shape.  Saying this, he seated\\r\\nhimself at a small table, on which were a pen and\\r\\nink, but no paper.  He looked for some in a drawer,\\r\\nbut found none.Never mind, said he\\r\\nat length, this will answer; and he drew\\r\\nfrom his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to\\r\\nbe very dirty foolscap, and made upon it a rough drawing\\r\\nwith the pen.  While he did this, I retained my\\r\\nseat by the fire, for I was still chilly.  When\\r\\nthe design was complete, he handed it to me without\\r\\nrising.  As I received it, a loud growl was heard,\\r\\nsucceeded by a scratching at the door.  Jupiter\\r\\nopened it, and a large Newfoundland, belonging to Legrand,\\r\\nrushed in, leaped upon my shoulders, and loaded me\\r\\nwith caresses; for I had shown him much attention\\r\\nduring previous visits.  When his gambols were\\r\\nover, I looked at the paper, and, to speak the truth,\\r\\nfound myself not a little puzzled at what my friend\\r\\nhad depicted.Well! I said, after\\r\\ncontemplating it for some minutes, this is a\\r\\nstrange scarabÃ¦us, I must confess:  new to me: \\r\\nnever saw anything like it before ­unless\\r\\nit was a skull, or a deaths-head ­which\\r\\nit more nearly resembles than anything else that has\\r\\ncome under my observation.A deaths-head!\\r\\nechoed Legrand ­Oh ­yes ­well,\\r\\nit has something of that appearance upon paper, no\\r\\ndoubt.  The two upper black spots look like eyes,\\r\\neh? and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth ­and\\r\\nthen the shape of the whole is oval.Perhaps so, said I;\\r\\nbut, Legrand, I fear you are no artist. \\r\\nI must wait until I see the beetle itself, if I am\\r\\nto form any idea of its personal appearance.Well, I dont know,\\r\\nsaid he, a little nettled, I draw tolerably ­should\\r\\ndo it at least ­have had good masters, and\\r\\nflatter myself that I am not quite a blockhead.But, my dear fellow, you are\\r\\njoking then, said I, this is a very\\r\\npassable skull ­indeed, I may say that it\\r\\nis a very excellent skull, according to the vulgar\\r\\nnotions about such specimens of physiology ­and\\r\\nyour scarabÃ¦us must be the queerest scarabÃ¦us in\\r\\nthe world if it resembles it.  Why, we may get\\r\\nup a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this\\r\\nhint.  I presume you will call the bug scarabÃ¦us\\r\\ncaput hominis, or something of that kind ­there\\r\\nare many similar titles in the Natural Histories. \\r\\nBut where are the antennÃ¦ you spoke of?The antennÃ¦! said Legrand,\\r\\nwho seemed to be getting unaccountably warm upon the\\r\\nsubject; I am sure you must see the antennÃ¦. \\r\\nI made them as distinct as they are in the original\\r\\ninsect, and I presume that is sufficient.Well, well, I said,\\r\\nperhaps you have ­still I dont\\r\\nsee them; and I handed him the paper without\\r\\nadditional remark, not wishing to ruffle his temper;\\r\\nbut I was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken;\\r\\nhis ill humor puzzled me ­and, as for the\\r\\ndrawing of the beetle, there were positively no antennÃ¦\\r\\nvisible, and the whole did bear a very close resemblance\\r\\nto the ordinary cuts of a deaths-head.He received the paper very peevishly,\\r\\nand was about to crumple it, apparently to throw it\\r\\nin the fire, when a casual glance at the design seemed\\r\\nsuddenly to rivet his attention.  In an instant\\r\\nhis face grew violently red ­in another\\r\\nas excessively pale.  For some minutes he continued\\r\\nto scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat. \\r\\nAt length he arose, took a candle from the table,\\r\\nand proceeded to seat himself upon a sea-chest in\\r\\nthe farthest corner of the room.  Here again he\\r\\nmade an anxious examination of the paper; turning\\r\\nit in all directions.  He said nothing, however,\\r\\nand his conduct greatly astonished me; yet I thought\\r\\nit prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness\\r\\nof his temper by any comment.  Presently he took\\r\\nfrom his coat pocket a wallet, placed the paper carefully\\r\\nin it, and deposited both in a writing-desk, which\\r\\nhe locked.  He now grew more composed in his demeanor;\\r\\nbut his original air of enthusiasm had quite disappeared. \\r\\nYet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted. \\r\\nAs the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed\\r\\nin reverie, from which no sallies of mine could arouse\\r\\nhim.  It had been my intention to pass the night\\r\\nat the hut, as I had frequently done before, but,\\r\\nseeing my host in this mood, I deemed it proper to\\r\\ntake leave.  He did not press me to remain, but,\\r\\nas I departed, he shook my hand with even more than\\r\\nhis usual cordiality.It was about a month after this (and\\r\\nduring the interval I had seen nothing of Legrand)\\r\\nwhen I received a visit, at Charleston, from his man,\\r\\nJupiter.  I had never seen the good old negro look\\r\\nso dispirited, and I feared that some serious disaster\\r\\nhad befallen my friend.Well, Jup, said I, what\\r\\nis the matter now? ­how is your master?Why, to speak de troof, massa,\\r\\nhim not so berry well as mought be.Not well!  I am truly sorry\\r\\nto hear it.  What does he complain of?Dar! dats it! ­him\\r\\nneber plain of notin ­but him berry sick\\r\\nfor all dat.Very sick, Jupiter! ­why\\r\\ndidnt you say so at once?  Is he confined\\r\\nto bed?No, dat he aint! ­he\\r\\naint find nowhar ­dats just whar de\\r\\nshoe pinch ­my mind is got to be berry hebby\\r\\nbout poor Massa Will.Jupiter, I should like to understand\\r\\nwhat it is you are talking about.  You say your\\r\\nmaster is sick.  Hasnt he told you what\\r\\nails him?Why, massa, taint worf while\\r\\nfor to git mad about de matter ­Massa Will\\r\\nsay noffin at all aint de matter wid him ­but\\r\\nden what make him go about looking dis here\\r\\nway, wid he head down and he soldiers up, and as white\\r\\nas a gose?  And den he keep a syphon all de time ­Keeps a what, Jupiter?Keeps a syphon wid de figgurs\\r\\non de slate ­de queerest figgurs I ebber\\r\\ndid see.  Ise gittin to be skeered, I tell you. \\r\\nHab for to keep mighty tight eye pon him noovers. \\r\\nTodder day he gib me slip fore de sun up and was gone\\r\\nde whole ob de blessed day.  I had a\\r\\nbig stick ready cut for to gib him deuced good beating\\r\\nwhen he did come ­but Ise sich a fool\\r\\ndat I hadnt de heart arter all ­he\\r\\nlook so berry poorly.Eh? ­what? ­ah\\r\\nyes! ­upon the whole I think you had better\\r\\nnot be too severe with the poor fellow ­dont\\r\\nflog him, Jupiter ­he cant very well\\r\\nstand it ­but can you form no idea of what\\r\\nhas occasioned this illness, or rather this change\\r\\nof conduct?  Has anything unpleasant happened since\\r\\nI saw you?No, massa, dey aint bin noffin\\r\\nunpleasant since den ­twas fore den\\r\\nIm feared ­twas de berry day\\r\\nyou was dare.How? what do you mean?Why, massa, I mean de bug ­dare now.The what?De bug, ­Im\\r\\nberry sartain dat Massa Will bin bit somewhere bout\\r\\nde head by dat goole-bug.And what cause have you, Jupiter, for such\\r\\na supposition?Claws enuff, massa, and mouth\\r\\ntoo.  I nebber did see sick a deuced bug ­he\\r\\nkick and he bite ebery ting what cum near him. \\r\\nMassa Will cotch him fuss, but had for to let him\\r\\ngo gin mighty quick, I tell you ­den was\\r\\nde time he must ha got de bite.  I did nt\\r\\nlike de look oh de bug mouff, myself, no how, so I\\r\\nwould nt take hold ob him wid my finger,\\r\\nbut I cotch him wid a piece ob paper dat I found. \\r\\nI rap him up in de paper and stuff piece ob it\\r\\nin he mouff ­dat was de way.And you think, then, that your\\r\\nmaster was really bitten by the beetle, and that the\\r\\nbite made him sick?I do nt tink noffin\\r\\nabout it ­I nose it.  What make him dream\\r\\nbout de goole so much, if taint cause he bit by de\\r\\ngoole-bug?  Ise heerd bout dem goole-bugs\\r\\nfore dis.But how do you know he dreams about gold?How I know? why cause he talk about it in he\\r\\nsleep ­dats how I nose.Well, Jup, perhaps you are\\r\\nright; but to what fortunate circumstance am I to\\r\\nattribute the honor of a visit from you to-day?What de matter, massa?Did you bring any message from Mr. Legrand?No, massa, I bring dis\\r\\nhere pissel; and here Jupiter handed me\\r\\na note which ran thus:     MY DEAR   ­Why have I not seen you for so long\\r\\na time?  I hope you have not been so foolish as\\r\\nto take offence at any little brusquerie of\\r\\nmine; but no, that is improbable.  Since I saw\\r\\nyou I have had great cause for anxiety.  I have\\r\\nsomething to tell you, yet scarcely know how to tell\\r\\nit, or whether I should tell it at all.I have not been quite well for some\\r\\ndays past, and poor old Jup annoys me, almost beyond\\r\\nendurance, by his well-meant attentions Would you\\r\\nbelieve it? ­he had prepared a huge stick,\\r\\nthe other day, with which to chastise me for giving\\r\\nhim the slip, and spending the day, solus,\\r\\namong the hills on the main land.  I verily believe\\r\\nthat my ill looks alone saved me a flogging.I have made no addition to my cabinet since we met.If you can, in any way, make it convenient,\\r\\ncome over with Jupiter. Do come.  I wish\\r\\nto see you to-night, upon business of importance. \\r\\nI assure you that it is of the highest importance.        Ever\\r\\nyours,                     WILLIAM LEGRAND.There was something in the tone of\\r\\nthis note which gave me great uneasiness.  Its\\r\\nwhole style differed materially from that of Legrand. \\r\\nWhat could he be dreaming of?  What new crotchet\\r\\npossessed his excitable brain?  What business\\r\\nof the highest importance could he possibly\\r\\nhave to transact?  Jupiters account of\\r\\nhim boded no good.  I dreaded lest the continued\\r\\npressure of misfortune had, at length, fairly unsettled\\r\\nthe reason of my friend.  Without a moments\\r\\nhesitation, therefore, I prepared to accompany the\\r\\nnegro.Upon reaching the wharf, I noticed\\r\\na scythe and three spades, all apparently new, lying\\r\\nin the bottom of the boat in which we were to embark.What is the meaning of all this, Jup?\\r\\nI inquired.Him syfe, massa, and spade.Very true; but what are they doing here?Him de syfe and de spade what\\r\\nMassa Will sis pon my buying for him in de town, and\\r\\nde debbils own lot of money I had to gib for em.But what, in the name of all\\r\\nthat is mysterious, is your Massa Will\\r\\ngoing to do with scythes and spades?Dats more dan I\\r\\nknow, and debbil take me if I dont blieve tis\\r\\nmore dan he know, too.  But its all\\r\\ncum ob do bug.Finding that no satisfaction was to\\r\\nbe obtained of Jupiter, whose whole intellect seemed\\r\\nto be absorbed by de bug, I now stepped\\r\\ninto the boat and made sail.  With a fair and\\r\\nstrong breeze we soon ran into the little cove to\\r\\nthe northward of Fort Moultrie, and a walk of some\\r\\ntwo miles brought us to the hut.  It was about\\r\\nthree in the afternoon when we arrived.  Legrand\\r\\nhad been awaiting us in eager expectation.  He\\r\\ngrasped my hand with a nervous empressement which\\r\\nalarmed me and strengthened the suspicions already\\r\\nentertained.  His countenance was pale even to\\r\\nghastliness, and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural\\r\\nlustre.  After some inquiries respecting his health,\\r\\nI asked him, not knowing what better to say, if he\\r\\nhad yet obtained the scarabÃ¦us from Lieutenant G\\r\\n  .Oh, yes, he replied,\\r\\ncoloring violently, I got it from him the next\\r\\nmorning.  Nothing should tempt me to part with\\r\\nthat scarabÃ¦us.  Do you know that Jupiter is\\r\\nquite right about it?In what way? I asked, with a sad foreboding\\r\\nat heart.In supposing it to be a bug\\r\\nof real gold.  He said this with an air\\r\\nof profound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly\\r\\nshocked.This bug is to make my fortune,\\r\\nhe continued, with a triumphant smile, to reinstate\\r\\nme in my family possessions.  Is it any wonder,\\r\\nthen, that I prize it?  Since Fortune has thought\\r\\nfit to bestow it upon me, I have only to use it properly\\r\\nand I shall arrive at the gold of which it is the\\r\\nindex.  Jupiter; bring me that scarabÃ¦us!What! de bug, massa?  Id\\r\\nrudder not go fer trubble dat bug ­you\\r\\nmus git him for your own self. \\r\\nHereupon Legrand arose, with a grave and stately air,\\r\\nand brought me the beetle from a glass case in which\\r\\nit was enclosed.  It was a beautiful scarabÃ¦us,\\r\\nand, at that time, unknown to naturalists ­of\\r\\ncourse a great prize in a scientific point of view. \\r\\nThere were two round, black spots near one extremity\\r\\nof the back, and a long one near the other.  The\\r\\nscales were exceedingly hard and glossy, with all\\r\\nthe appearance of burnished gold.  The weight of\\r\\nthe insect was very remarkable, and, taking all things\\r\\ninto consideration, I could hardly blame Jupiter for\\r\\nhis opinion respecting it; but what to make of Legrands\\r\\nconcordance with that opinion, I could not, for the\\r\\nlife of me, tell.I sent for you, said\\r\\nhe, in a grandiloquent tone, when I had completed\\r\\nmy examination of the beetle, I sent for you,\\r\\nthat I might have your counsel and assistance in furthering\\r\\nthe views of Fate and of the bug ­My dear Legrand, I cried,\\r\\ninterrupting him, you are certainly unwell,\\r\\nand had better use some little precautions.  You\\r\\nshall go to bed, and I will remain with you a few\\r\\ndays, until you get over this.  You are feverish\\r\\nand ­Feel my pulse, said he.I felt it, and, to say the truth,\\r\\nfound not the slightest indication of fever.But you may be ill and yet\\r\\nhave no fever.  Allow me this once to prescribe\\r\\nfor you.  In the first place, go to bed.  In\\r\\nthe next ­You are mistaken, he\\r\\ninterposed, I am as well as I can expect to\\r\\nbe under the excitement which I suffer.  If you\\r\\nreally wish me well, you will relieve this excitement.And how is this to be done?Very easily.  Jupiter and\\r\\nmyself are going upon an expedition into the hills,\\r\\nupon the main land, and, in this expedition we shall\\r\\nneed the aid of some person in whom we can confide. \\r\\nYou are the only one we can trust.  Whether we\\r\\nsucceed or fail, the excitement which you now perceive\\r\\nin me will be equally allayed.I am anxious to oblige you\\r\\nin any way, I replied; but do you mean\\r\\nto say that this infernal beetle has any connection\\r\\nwith your expedition into the hills?It has.Then, Legrand, I can become a party to no such\\r\\nabsurd proceeding.I am sorry ­very sorry ­for\\r\\nwe shall have to try it by ourselves.Try it by yourselves! \\r\\nThe man is surely mad! ­but stay! ­how\\r\\nlong do you propose to be absent?Probably all night.  We\\r\\nshall start immediately, and be back, at all events,\\r\\nby sunrise.And will you promise me, upon\\r\\nyour honor, that when this freak of yours is over,\\r\\nand the bug business (good God!) settled to your satisfaction,\\r\\nyou will then return home and follow my advice implicitly,\\r\\nas that of your physician?Yes; I promise; and now let\\r\\nus be off, for we have no time to lose.With a heavy heart I accompanied my\\r\\nfriend.  We started about four oclock ­Legrand,\\r\\nJupiter, the dog, and myself.  Jupiter had with\\r\\nhim the scythe and spades ­the whole of\\r\\nwhich he insisted upon carrying ­more through\\r\\nfear, it seemed to me, of trusting either of the implements\\r\\nwithin reach of his master, than from any excess of\\r\\nindustry or complaisance.  His demeanor was dogged\\r\\nin the extreme, and dat deuced bug were\\r\\nthe sole words which escaped his lips during the journey. \\r\\nFor my own part, I had charge of a couple of dark\\r\\nlanterns, while Legrand contented himself with the\\r\\nscarabÃ¦us, which he carried attached to the end of\\r\\na bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and fro, with the\\r\\nair of a conjuror, as he went.  When I observed\\r\\nthis last, plain evidence of my friends aberration\\r\\nof mind, I could scarcely refrain from tears. \\r\\nI thought it best, however, to humor his fancy, at\\r\\nleast for the present, or until I could adopt some\\r\\nmore energetic measures with a chance of success. \\r\\nIn the mean time I endeavored, but all in vain, to\\r\\nsound him in regard to the object of the expedition. \\r\\nHaving succeeded in inducing me to accompany him,\\r\\nhe seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any\\r\\ntopic of minor importance, and to all my questions\\r\\nvouchsafed no other reply than we shall see!We crossed the creek at the head of\\r\\nthe island by means of a skiff; and, ascending the\\r\\nhigh grounds on the shore of the main land, proceeded\\r\\nin a northwesterly direction, through a tract of country\\r\\nexcessively wild and desolate, where no trace of a\\r\\nhuman footstep was to be seen.  Legrand led the\\r\\nway with decision; pausing only for an instant, here\\r\\nand there, to consult what appeared to be certain\\r\\nlandmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion.In this manner we journeyed for about\\r\\ntwo hours, and the sun was just setting when we entered\\r\\na region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen. \\r\\nIt was a species of table land, near the summit of\\r\\nan almost inaccessible hill, densely wooded from base\\r\\nto pinnacle, and interspersed with huge crags that\\r\\nappeared to lie loosely upon the soil, and in many\\r\\ncases were prevented from precipitating themselves\\r\\ninto the valleys below, merely by the support of the\\r\\ntrees against which they reclined.  Deep ravines,\\r\\nin various directions, gave an air of still sterner\\r\\nsolemnity to the scene.The natural platform to which we had\\r\\nclambered was thickly overgrown with brambles, through\\r\\nwhich we soon discovered that it would have been impossible\\r\\nto force our way but for the scythe; and Jupiter, by\\r\\ndirection of his master, proceeded to clear for us\\r\\na path to the foot of an enormously tall tulip-tree,\\r\\nwhich stood, with some eight or ten oaks, upon the\\r\\nlevel, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees\\r\\nwhich I had then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage\\r\\nand form, in the wide spread of its branches, and\\r\\nin the general majesty of its appearance.  When\\r\\nwe reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and\\r\\nasked him if he thought he could climb it.  The\\r\\nold man seemed a little staggered by the question,\\r\\nand for some moments made no reply.  At length\\r\\nhe approached the huge trunk, walked slowly around\\r\\nit, and examined it with minute attention.  When\\r\\nhe had completed his scrutiny, he merely said,Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he ebber see\\r\\nin he life.Then up with you as soon as\\r\\npossible, for it will soon be too dark to see what\\r\\nwe are about.How far mus go up, massa?\\r\\ninquired Jupiter.Get up the main trunk first,\\r\\nand then I will tell you which way to go ­and\\r\\nhere ­stop! take this beetle with you.De bug, Massa Will! ­de\\r\\ngoole bug! cried the negro, drawing back in\\r\\ndismay ­what for mus tote de\\r\\nbug way up de tree? ­d-n if I do!If you are afraid, Jup, a great\\r\\nbig negro like you, to take hold of a harmless little\\r\\ndead beetle, why you can carry it up by this string ­but,\\r\\nif you do not take it up with you in some way, I shall\\r\\nbe under the necessity of breaking your head with\\r\\nthis shovel.What de matter now, massa?\\r\\nsaid Jup, evidently shamed into compliance; always\\r\\nwant for to raise fuss wid old nigger.  Was only\\r\\nfunnin any how.  Me feered de bug! what I keer\\r\\nfor de bug? Here he took cautiously hold of\\r\\nthe extreme end of the string, and, maintaining the\\r\\ninsect as far from his person as circumstances would\\r\\npermit, prepared to ascend the tree.In youth, the tulip-tree, or Liriodendron\\r\\nTulipferum, the most magnificent of American foresters,\\r\\nhas a trunk peculiarly smooth, and often rises to\\r\\na great height without lateral branches; but, in its\\r\\nriper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while\\r\\nmany short limbs make their appearance on the stem. \\r\\nThus the difficulty of ascension, in the present case,\\r\\nlay more in semblance than in reality.  Embracing\\r\\nthe huge cylinder, as closely as possible, with his\\r\\narms and knees, seizing with his hands some projections,\\r\\nand resting his naked toes upon others, Jupiter, after\\r\\none or two narrow escapes from falling, at length\\r\\nwriggled himself into the first great fork, and seemed\\r\\nto consider the whole business as virtually accomplished. \\r\\nThe risk of the achievement was, in fact, now over,\\r\\nalthough the climber was some sixty or seventy feet\\r\\nfrom the ground.Which way mus go now, Massa Will?\\r\\nhe asked.Keep up the largest branch ­the\\r\\none on this side, said Legrand.  The negro\\r\\nobeyed him promptly, and apparently with but little\\r\\ntrouble; ascending higher and higher, until no glimpse\\r\\nof his squat figure could be obtained through the\\r\\ndense foliage which enveloped it.  Presently his\\r\\nvoice was heard in a sort of halloo.How much fudder is got for go?How high up are you? asked Legrand.Ebber so fur, replied\\r\\nthe negro; can see de sky fru de top ob\\r\\nde tree.Never mind the sky, but attend\\r\\nto what I say.  Look down the trunk and count\\r\\nthe limbs below you on this side.  How many limbs\\r\\nhave you passed?One, two, tree, four, fibe ­I\\r\\ndone pass fibe big limb, massa, pon dis\\r\\nside.Then go one limb higher.In a few minutes the voice was heard\\r\\nagain, announcing that the seventh limb was attained.Now, Jup, cried Legrand,\\r\\nevidently much excited, I want you to work\\r\\nyour way out upon that limb as far as you can. \\r\\nIf you see anything strange, let me know. \\r\\nBy this time what little doubt I might have entertained\\r\\nof my poor friends insanity, was put finally\\r\\nat rest.  I had no alternative but to conclude\\r\\nhim stricken with lunacy, and I became seriously anxious\\r\\nabout getting him home.  While I was pondering\\r\\nupon what was best to be done, Jupiters voice\\r\\nwas again heard.Mos feerd for to ventur pon\\r\\ndis limb berry far ­tis dead limb putty\\r\\nmuch all de way.Did you say it was a dead limb,\\r\\nJupiter? cried Legrand in a quavering voice.Yes, massa, him dead as de\\r\\ndoor-nail ­done up for sartain ­done\\r\\ndeparted dis here life.What in the name heaven shall\\r\\nI do? asked Legrand, seemingly in the greatest\\r\\ndistress.  Do! said I, glad of an\\r\\nopportunity to interpose a word, why come home\\r\\nand go to bed.  Come now! ­thats\\r\\na fine fellow.  Its getting late, and,\\r\\nbesides, you remember your promise.Jupiter, cried he, without\\r\\nheeding me in the least, do you hear me?Yes, Massa Will, hear you ebber so plain.Try the wood well, then, with\\r\\nyour knife, and see if you think it very rotten.Him rotten, massa, sure nuff,\\r\\nreplied the negro in a few moments, but not\\r\\nso berry rotten as mought be.  Mought ventur out\\r\\nleetle way pon de limb by myself, dats true.By yourself! ­what do you mean?Why I mean de bug.  Tis\\r\\nberry hebby bug.  Spose I drop him down fuss,\\r\\nand den de limb wont break wid just de weight\\r\\nob one nigger.You infernal scoundrel!\\r\\ncried Legrand, apparently much relieved, what\\r\\ndo you mean by telling me such nonsense as that? \\r\\nAs sure as you drop that beetle Ill break your\\r\\nneck.  Look here, Jupiter, do you hear me?Yes, massa, neednt hollo at poor nigger\\r\\ndat style.Well! now listen! ­if\\r\\nyou will venture out on the limb as far as you think\\r\\nsafe, and not let go the beetle, Ill make you\\r\\na present of a silver dollar as soon as you get down.Im gwine, Massa Will ­deed\\r\\nI is, replied the negro very promptly ­mos\\r\\nout to the eend now.Out to the end! here\\r\\nfairly screamed Legrand, do you say you are\\r\\nout to the end of that limb?Soon be to de eend, massa, ­o-o-o-o-oh! \\r\\nLor-gol-a-marcy! what is dis here pon de\\r\\ntree?Well! cried Legrand, highly delighted,\\r\\nwhat is it?Why taint noffin but a skull ­somebody\\r\\nbin lef him head up de tree, and de crows done gobble\\r\\nebery bit ob de meat off.A skull, you say! ­very\\r\\nwell! ­how is it fastened to the limb? ­what\\r\\nholds it on?Sure nuff, massa; mus\\r\\nlook.  Why dis berry curous sarcumstance,\\r\\npon my word ­dares a great big nail\\r\\nin de skull, what fastens ob it on to de tree.Well now, Jupiter, do exactly\\r\\nas I tell you ­do you hear?Yes, massa.Pay attention, then! ­find the left\\r\\neye of the skull.Hum! hoo! dats good! why dare aint no\\r\\neye lef at all.Curse your stupidity! do you know your right\\r\\nhand from your left?Yes, I nose dat ­nose\\r\\nall bout dat ­tis my lef hand what I chops\\r\\nde wood wid.To be sure! you are left-handed;\\r\\nand your left eye is on the same side as your left\\r\\nhand.  Now, I suppose, you can find the left eye\\r\\nof the skull, or the place where the left eye has\\r\\nbeen.  Have you found it?Here was a long pause.  At length the negro asked,Is de lef eye of de skull pon\\r\\nde same side as de lef hand of de skull, too? ­cause\\r\\nde skull aint got not a bit ob a hand at all ­nebber\\r\\nmind!  I got de lef eye now ­here de\\r\\nlef eye! what mus do wid it?Let the beetle drop through\\r\\nit, as far as the string will reach ­but\\r\\nbe careful and not let go your hold of the string.All dat done, Massa Will; mighty\\r\\neasy ting for to put de bug fru de hole ­look\\r\\nout for him dare below!During this colloquy no portion of\\r\\nJupiters person could be seen; but the beetle,\\r\\nwhich he had suffered to descend, was now visible at\\r\\nthe end of the string, and glistened, like a globe\\r\\nof burnished gold, in the last rays of the setting\\r\\nsun, some of which still faintly illumined the eminence\\r\\nupon which we stood.  The scarabÃ¦us hung quite\\r\\nclear of any branches, and, if allowed to fall, would\\r\\nhave fallen at our feet.  Legrand immediately\\r\\ntook the scythe, and cleared with it a circular space,\\r\\nthree or four yards in diameter, just beneath the insect,\\r\\nand, having accomplished this, ordered Jupiter to\\r\\nlet go the string and come down from the tree.Driving a peg, with great nicety,\\r\\ninto the ground, at the precise spot where the beetle\\r\\nfell, my friend now produced from his pocket a tape\\r\\nmeasure.  Fastening one end of this at that point\\r\\nof the trunk, of the tree which was nearest the peg,\\r\\nhe unrolled it till it reached the peg, and thence\\r\\nfarther unrolled it, in the direction already established\\r\\nby the two points of the tree and the peg, for the\\r\\ndistance of fifty feet ­Jupiter clearing\\r\\naway the brambles with the scythe.  At the spot\\r\\nthus attained a second peg was driven, and about this,\\r\\nas a centre, a rude circle, about four feet in diameter,\\r\\ndescribed.  Taking now a spade himself, and giving\\r\\none to Jupiter and one to me, Legrand begged us to\\r\\nset about digging as quickly as possible.To speak the truth, I had no especial\\r\\nrelish for such amusement at any time, and, at that\\r\\nparticular moment, would most willingly have declined\\r\\nit; for the night was coming on, and I felt much fatigued\\r\\nwith the exercise already taken; but I saw no mode\\r\\nof escape, and was fearful of disturbing my poor friends\\r\\nequanimity by a refusal.  Could I have depended,\\r\\nindeed, upon Jupiters aid, I would have had\\r\\nno hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home\\r\\nby force; but I was too well assured of the old negros\\r\\ndisposition, to hope that he would assist me, under\\r\\nany circumstances, in a personal contest with his master. \\r\\nI made no doubt that the latter had been infected\\r\\nwith some of the innumerable Southern superstitions\\r\\nabout money buried, and that his phantasy had received\\r\\nconfirmation by the finding of the scarabÃ¦us, or,\\r\\nperhaps, by Jupiters obstinacy in maintaining\\r\\nit to be a bug of real gold.  A\\r\\nmind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by\\r\\nsuch suggestions ­especially if chiming\\r\\nin with favorite preconceived ideas ­and\\r\\nthen I called to mind the poor fellows speech\\r\\nabout the beetles being the index of\\r\\nhis fortune.  Upon the whole, I was sadly\\r\\nvexed and puzzled, but, at length, I concluded to make\\r\\na virtue of necessity ­to dig with a good\\r\\nwill, and thus the sooner to convince the visionary,\\r\\nby ocular demonstration, of the fallacy of the opinions\\r\\nhe entertained.The lanterns having been lit, we all\\r\\nfell to work with a zeal worthy a more rational cause;\\r\\nand, as the glare fell upon our persons and implements,\\r\\nI could not help thinking how picturesque a group we\\r\\ncomposed, and how strange and suspicious our labors\\r\\nmust have appeared to any interloper who, by chance,\\r\\nmight have stumbled upon our whereabouts.We dug very steadily for two hours. \\r\\nLittle was said; and our chief embarrassment lay in\\r\\nthe yelpings of the dog, who took exceeding interest\\r\\nin our proceedings.  He, at length, became so obstreperous\\r\\nthat we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some\\r\\nstragglers in the vicinity; ­or, rather,\\r\\nthis was the apprehension of Legrand; ­for\\r\\nmyself, I should have rejoiced at any interruption\\r\\nwhich might have enabled me to get the wanderer home. \\r\\nThe noise was, at length, very effectually silenced\\r\\nby Jupiter, who, getting out of the hole with a dogged\\r\\nair of deliberation, tied the brutes mouth up\\r\\nwith one of his suspenders, and then returned, with\\r\\na grave chuckle, to his task.When the time mentioned had expired,\\r\\nwe had reached a depth of five feet, and yet no signs\\r\\nof any treasure became manifest.  A general pause\\r\\nensued, and I began to hope that the farce was at an\\r\\nend.  Legrand, however, although evidently much\\r\\ndisconcerted, wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced. \\r\\nWe had excavated the entire circle of four feet diameter,\\r\\nand now we slightly enlarged the limit, and went to\\r\\nthe farther depth of two feet.  Still nothing\\r\\nappeared.  The gold-seeker, whom I sincerely pitied,\\r\\nat length clambered from the pit, with the bitterest\\r\\ndisappointment imprinted upon every feature, and proceeded,\\r\\nslowly and reluctantly, to put on his coat, which\\r\\nhe had thrown off at the beginning of his labor. \\r\\nIn the mean time I made no remark.  Jupiter, at\\r\\na signal from his master, began to gather up his tools. \\r\\nThis done, and the dog having been unmuzzled, we turned\\r\\nin profound silence towards home.We had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps\\r\\nin this direction, when, with a loud oath, Legrand\\r\\nstrode up to Jupiter, and seized him by the collar. \\r\\nThe astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the\\r\\nfullest extent, let fall the spades, and fell upon\\r\\nhis knees.You scoundrel, said\\r\\nLegrand, hissing out the syllables from between his\\r\\nclenched teeth ­you infernal black\\r\\nvillain! ­speak, I tell you! ­answer\\r\\nme this instant, without prevarication! ­which ­which\\r\\nis your left eye?Oh, my golly, Massa Will! aint\\r\\ndis here my lef eye for sartain? roared\\r\\nthe terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his right\\r\\norgan of vision, and holding it there with a desperate\\r\\npertinacity, as if in immediate dread of his masters\\r\\nattempt at a gouge.I thought so! ­I\\r\\nknew it! hurrah! vociferated Legrand, letting\\r\\nthe negro go, and executing a series of curvets and\\r\\ncaracols, much to the astonishment of his valet, who,\\r\\narising from his knees, looked, mutely, from his master\\r\\nto myself, and then from myself to his master.Come! we must go back,\\r\\nsaid the latter, the games not up yet;\\r\\nand he again led the way to the tulip-tree.Jupiter, said he, when\\r\\nwe reached its foot, come here! was the skull\\r\\nnailed to the limb with the face outwards, or with\\r\\nthe face to the limb?De face was out, massa, so\\r\\ndat de crows could get at de eyes good, widout any\\r\\ntrouble.Well, then, was it this eye\\r\\nor that through which you dropped the beetle? ­here\\r\\nLegrand touched each of Jupiters eyes.Twas dis eye, massa ­de\\r\\nlef eye ­jis as you tell me, and here\\r\\nit was his right eye that the negro indicated.That will do ­must try it again.Here my friend, about whose madness\\r\\nI now saw, or fancied that I saw, certain indications\\r\\nof method, removed the peg which marked the spot where\\r\\nthe beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to the\\r\\nwestward of its former position.  Taking, now,\\r\\nthe tape measure from the nearest point of the trunk\\r\\nto the peg, as before, and continuing the extension\\r\\nin a straight line to the distance of fifty feet, a\\r\\nspot was indicated, removed, by several yards, from\\r\\nthe point at which we had been digging.Around the new position a circle,\\r\\nsomewhat larger than in the former instance, was now\\r\\ndescribed, and we again set to work with the spades. \\r\\nI was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding\\r\\nwhat had occasioned the change in my thoughts, I felt\\r\\nno longer any great aversion from the labor imposed. \\r\\nI had become most unaccountably interested ­nay,\\r\\neven excited.  Perhaps there was something, amid\\r\\nall the extravagant demeanor of Legrand ­some\\r\\nair of forethought, or of deliberation, which impressed\\r\\nme.  I dug eagerly, and now and then caught myself\\r\\nactually looking, with something that very much resembled\\r\\nexpectation, for the fancied treasure, the vision\\r\\nof which had demented my unfortunate companion. \\r\\nAt a period when such vagaries of thought most fully\\r\\npossessed me, and when we had been at work perhaps\\r\\nan hour and a half, we were again interrupted by the\\r\\nviolent howlings of the dog.  His uneasiness, in\\r\\nthe first instance, had been, evidently, but the result\\r\\nof playfulness or caprice, but he now assumed a bitter\\r\\nand serious tone.  Upon Jupiters again\\r\\nattempting to muzzle him, he made furious resistance,\\r\\nand, leaping into the hole, tore up the mould frantically\\r\\nwith his claws.  In a few seconds he had uncovered\\r\\na mass of human bones, forming two complete skeletons,\\r\\nintermingled with several buttons of metal, and what\\r\\nappeared to be the dust of decayed woollen.  One\\r\\nor two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a\\r\\nlarge Spanish knife, and, as we dug farther, three\\r\\nor four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to\\r\\nlight.At sight of these the joy of Jupiter\\r\\ncould scarcely be restrained, but the countenance\\r\\nof his master wore an air of extreme disappointment\\r\\nHe urged us, however, to continue our exertions, and\\r\\nthe words were hardly uttered when I stumbled and\\r\\nfell forward, having caught the toe of my boot in\\r\\na large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose\\r\\nearth.We now worked in earnest, and never\\r\\ndid I pass ten minutes of more intense excitement. \\r\\nDuring this interval we had fairly unearthed an oblong\\r\\nchest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation\\r\\nand wonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected\\r\\nto some mineralizing process ­perhaps that\\r\\nof the Bi-chloride of Mercury.  This box was three\\r\\nfeet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and\\r\\na half feet deep.  It was firmly secured by bands\\r\\nof wrought iron, riveted, and forming a kind of open\\r\\ntrelliswork over the whole.  On each side of the\\r\\nchest, near the top, were three rings of iron ­six\\r\\nin all ­by means of which a firm hold could\\r\\nbe obtained by six persons.  Our utmost united\\r\\nendeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly\\r\\nin its bed.  We at once saw the impossibility\\r\\nof removing so great a weight.  Luckily, the sole\\r\\nfastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts. \\r\\nThese we drew back ­trembling and panting\\r\\nwith anxiety.  In an instant, a treasure of incalculable\\r\\nvalue lay gleaming before us.  As the rays of the\\r\\nlanterns fell within the pit, there flashed upwards\\r\\na glow and a glare, from a confused heap of gold and\\r\\nof jewels, that absolutely dazzled our eyes.I shall not pretend to describe the\\r\\nfeelings with which I gazed.  Amazement was, of\\r\\ncourse, predominant.  Legrand appeared exhausted\\r\\nwith excitement, and spoke very few words.  Jupiters\\r\\ncountenance wore, for some minutes, as deadly a pallor\\r\\nas it is possible, in nature of things, for any negros\\r\\nvisage to assume.  He seemed stupified ­thunderstricken. \\r\\nPresently he fell upon his knees in the pit, and, burying\\r\\nhis naked arms up to the elbows in gold, let them\\r\\nthere remain, as if enjoying the luxury of a bath. \\r\\nAt length, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in\\r\\na soliloquy,And dis all cum ob\\r\\nde goole-bug! de putty goole bug! de poor little\\r\\ngoole-bug, what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob\\r\\nstyle!  Aint you shamed ob yourself, nigger? ­answer\\r\\nme dat!It became necessary, at last, that\\r\\nI should arouse both master and valet to the expediency\\r\\nof removing the treasure.  It was growing late,\\r\\nand it behooved us to make exertion, that we might\\r\\nget every thing housed before daylight.  It was\\r\\ndifficult to say what should be done, and much time\\r\\nwas spent in deliberation ­so confused were\\r\\nthe ideas of all.  We, finally, lightened the\\r\\nbox by removing two thirds of its contents, when we\\r\\nwere enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from the\\r\\nhole.  The articles taken out were deposited among\\r\\nthe brambles, and the dog left to guard them, with\\r\\nstrict orders from Jupiter neither, upon any pretence,\\r\\nto stir from the spot, nor to open his mouth until\\r\\nour return.  We then hurriedly made for home with\\r\\nthe chest; reaching the hut in safety, but after excessive\\r\\ntoil, at one oclock in the morning.  Worn\\r\\nout as we were, it was not in human nature to do more\\r\\nimmediately.  We rested until two, and had supper;\\r\\nstarting for the hills immediately afterwards, armed\\r\\nwith three stout sacks, which, by good luck, were upon\\r\\nthe premises.  A little before four we arrived\\r\\nat the pit, divided the remainder of the booty, as\\r\\nequally as might be, among us, and, leaving the holes\\r\\nunfilled, again set out for the hut, at which, for\\r\\nthe second time, we deposited our golden burthens,\\r\\njust as the first faint streaks of the dawn gleamed\\r\\nfrom over the tree-tops in the East.We were now thoroughly broken down;\\r\\nbut the intense excitement of the time denied us repose. \\r\\nAfter an unquiet slumber of some three or four hours\\r\\nduration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination\\r\\nof our treasure.The chest had been full to the brim,\\r\\nand we spent the whole day, and the greater part of\\r\\nthe next night, in a scrutiny of its contents. \\r\\nThere had been nothing like order or arrangement. \\r\\nEvery thing had been heaped in promiscuously. \\r\\nHaving assorted all with care, we found ourselves\\r\\npossessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first\\r\\nsupposed.  In coin there was rather more than\\r\\nfour hundred and fifty thousand dollars ­estimating\\r\\nthe value of the pieces, as accurately as we could,\\r\\nby the tables of the period.  There was not a particle\\r\\nof silver.  All was gold of antique date and of\\r\\ngreat variety ­French, Spanish, and German\\r\\nmoney, with a few English guineas, and some counters,\\r\\nof which we had never seen specimens before. \\r\\nThere were several very large and heavy coins, so\\r\\nworn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions. \\r\\nThere was no American money.  The value of the\\r\\njewels we found more difficulty in estimating. \\r\\nThere were diamonds ­some of them exceedingly\\r\\nlarge and fine ­a hundred and ten in all,\\r\\nand not one of them small; eighteen rubies of remarkable\\r\\nbrilliancy; ­three hundred and ten emeralds,\\r\\nall very beautiful; and twenty-one sapphires, with\\r\\nan opal.  These stones had all been broken from\\r\\ntheir settings and thrown loose in the chest. \\r\\nThe settings themselves, which we picked out from\\r\\namong the other gold, appeared to have been beaten\\r\\nup with hammers, as if to prevent identification. \\r\\nBesides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid\\r\\ngold ornaments; ­nearly two hundred massive\\r\\nfinger and earrings; ­rich chains ­thirty\\r\\nof these, if I remember; ­eighty-three very\\r\\nlarge and heavy crucifixes; ­five gold censers\\r\\nof great value; ­a prodigious golden punch\\r\\nbowl, ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and\\r\\nBacchanalian figures; with two sword-handles exquisitely\\r\\nembossed, and many other smaller articles which I\\r\\ncannot recollect.  The weight of these valuables\\r\\nexceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois;\\r\\nand in this estimate I have not included one hundred\\r\\nand ninety-seven superb gold watches; three of the\\r\\nnumber being worth each five hundred dollars, if one. \\r\\nMany of them were very old, and as time keepers valueless;\\r\\nthe works having suffered, more or less, from corrosion ­but\\r\\nall were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth. \\r\\nWe estimated the entire contents of the chest, that\\r\\nnight, at a million and a half of dollars; and upon\\r\\nthe subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels\\r\\n(a few being retained for our own use), it was found\\r\\nthat we had greatly undervalued the treasure. \\r\\nWhen, at length, we had concluded our examination,\\r\\nand the intense excitement of the time had, in some\\r\\nmeasure, subsided, Legrand, who saw that I was dying\\r\\nwith impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary\\r\\nriddle, entered into a full detail of all the circumstances\\r\\nconnected with it.You remember; said he,\\r\\nthe night when I handed you the rough sketch\\r\\nI had made of the scarabÃ¦us.  You recollect also,\\r\\nthat I became quite vexed at you for insisting that\\r\\nmy drawing resembled a deaths-head.  When\\r\\nyou first made this assertion I thought you were jesting;\\r\\nbut afterwards I called to mind the peculiar spots\\r\\non the back of the insect, and admitted to myself\\r\\nthat your remark had some little foundation in fact. \\r\\nStill, the sneer at my graphic powers irritated me ­for\\r\\nI am considered a good artist ­and, therefore,\\r\\nwhen you handed me the scrap of parchment, I was about\\r\\nto crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire.The scrap of paper, you mean, said I.No; it had much of the appearance\\r\\nof paper, and at first I supposed it to be such, but\\r\\nwhen I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at once,\\r\\nto be a piece of very thin parchment.  It was quite\\r\\ndirty, you remember.  Well, as I was in the very\\r\\nact of crumpling it up, my glance fell upon the sketch\\r\\nat which you had been looking, and you may imagine\\r\\nmy astonishment when I perceived, in fact, the figure\\r\\nof a deaths-head just where, it seemed to me,\\r\\nI had made the drawing of the beetle.  For a moment\\r\\nI was too much amazed to think with accuracy. \\r\\nI knew that my design was very different in detail\\r\\nfrom this ­although there was a certain\\r\\nsimilarity in general outline.  Presently I took\\r\\na candle, and seating myself at the other end of the\\r\\nroom, proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely. \\r\\nUpon turning it over, I saw my own sketch upon the\\r\\nreverse, just as I had made it.  My first idea,\\r\\nnow, was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity\\r\\nof outline ­at the singular coincidence\\r\\ninvolved in the fact, that unknown to me, there should\\r\\nhave been a skull upon the other side of the parchment,\\r\\nimmediately beneath my figure of the scarabÃ¦us, and\\r\\nthat this skull, not only in outline, but in size,\\r\\nshould so closely resemble my drawing.  I say the\\r\\nsingularity of this coincidence absolutely stupified\\r\\nme for a time.  This is the usual effect of such\\r\\ncoincidences.  The mind struggles to establish\\r\\na connexion ­a sequence of cause and effect ­and,\\r\\nbeing unable to do so, suffers a species of temporary\\r\\nparalysis.  But, when I recovered from this stupor,\\r\\nthere dawned upon me gradually a conviction which\\r\\nstartled me even far more than the coincidence. \\r\\nI began distinctly, positively, to remember that there\\r\\nhad been no drawing upon the parchment when I made\\r\\nmy sketch of the scarabÃ¦us.  I became perfectly\\r\\ncertain of this; for I recollected turning up first\\r\\none side and then the other, in search of the cleanest\\r\\nspot.  Had the skull been then there, of course\\r\\nI could not have failed to notice it.  Here was\\r\\nindeed a mystery which I felt it impossible to explain;\\r\\nbut, even at that early moment, there seemed to glimmer,\\r\\nfaintly, within the most remote and secret chambers\\r\\nof my intellect, a glow-worm-like conception of that\\r\\ntruth which last nights adventure brought to\\r\\nso magnificent a demonstration.  I arose at once,\\r\\nand putting the parchment securely away, dismissed\\r\\nall farther reflection until I should be alone.When you had gone, and when\\r\\nJupiter was fast asleep, I betook myself to a more\\r\\nmethodical investigation of the affair.  In the\\r\\nfirst place I considered the manner in which the parchment\\r\\nhad come into my possession.  The spot where we\\r\\ndiscovered the scarabaeus was on the coast of the\\r\\nmain land, about a mile eastward of the island, and\\r\\nbut a short distance above high water mark.  Upon\\r\\nmy taking hold of it, it gave me a sharp bite, which\\r\\ncaused me to let it drop.  Jupiter, with his accustomed\\r\\ncaution, before seizing the insect, which had flown\\r\\ntowards him, looked about him for a leaf, or something\\r\\nof that nature, by which to take hold of it. \\r\\nIt was at this moment that his eyes, and mine also,\\r\\nfell upon the scrap of parchment, which I then supposed\\r\\nto be paper.  It was lying half buried in the\\r\\nsand, a corner sticking up.  Near the spot where\\r\\nwe found it, I observed the remnants of the hull of\\r\\nwhat appeared to have been a ships long boat. \\r\\nThe wreck seemed to have been there for a very great\\r\\nwhile; for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely\\r\\nbe traced.Well, Jupiter picked up the\\r\\nparchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and gave it to\\r\\nme.  Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and\\r\\non the way met Lieutenant G-.  I showed him the\\r\\ninsect, and he begged me to let him take it to the\\r\\nfort.  Upon my consenting, he thrust it forthwith\\r\\ninto his waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in\\r\\nwhich it had been wrapped, and which I had continued\\r\\nto hold in my hand during his inspection.  Perhaps\\r\\nhe dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it best\\r\\nto make sure of the prize at once ­you know\\r\\nhow enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected with\\r\\nNatural History.  At the same time, without being\\r\\nconscious of it, I must have deposited the parchment\\r\\nin my own pocket.You remember that when I went\\r\\nto the table, for the purpose of making a sketch of\\r\\nthe beetle, I found no paper where it was usually kept. \\r\\nI looked in the drawer, and found none there. \\r\\nI searched my pockets, hoping to find an old letter,\\r\\nwhen my hand fell upon the parchment.  I thus\\r\\ndetail the precise mode in which it came into my possession;\\r\\nfor the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force.No doubt you will think me\\r\\nfanciful ­but I had already established a\\r\\nkind of connexion.  I had put together two links\\r\\nof a great chain.  There was a boat lying upon\\r\\na sea-coast, and not far from the boat was a parchment ­not\\r\\na paper ­with a skull depicted upon it. \\r\\nYou will, of course, ask where is the connexion?\\r\\nI reply that the skull, or deaths-head, is\\r\\nthe well-known emblem of the pirate.  The flag\\r\\nof the deaths head is hoisted in all engagements.I have said that the scrap\\r\\nwas parchment, and not paper.  Parchment is durable ­almost\\r\\nimperishable.  Matters of little moment are rarely\\r\\nconsigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary\\r\\npurposes of drawing or writing, it is not nearly so\\r\\nwell adapted as paper.  This reflection suggested\\r\\nsome meaning ­some relevancy ­in\\r\\nthe deaths-head.  I did not fail to observe,\\r\\nalso, the form of the parchment.  Although one\\r\\nof its corners had been, by some accident, destroyed,\\r\\nit could be seen that the original form was oblong. \\r\\nIt was just such a slip, indeed, as might have been\\r\\nchosen for a memorandum ­for a record of\\r\\nsomething to be long remembered and carefully preserved.But, I interposed, you\\r\\nsay that the skull was not upon the parchment when\\r\\nyou made the drawing of the beetle.  How then do\\r\\nyou trace any connexion between the boat and the skull ­since\\r\\nthis latter, according to your own admission, must\\r\\nhave been designed (God only knows how or by whom)\\r\\nat some period subsequent to your sketching the scarabÃ¦us?Ah, hereupon turns the whole\\r\\nmystery; although the secret, at this point, I had\\r\\ncomparatively little difficulty in solving.  My\\r\\nsteps were sure, and could afford but a single result. \\r\\nI reasoned, for example, thus:  When I drew the\\r\\nscarabÃ¦us, there was no skull apparent upon the parchment. \\r\\nWhen I had completed the drawing I gave it to you,\\r\\nand observed you narrowly until you returned it. \\r\\nYou, therefore, did not design the skull, and no one\\r\\nelse was present to do it.  Then it was not done\\r\\nby human agency.  And nevertheless it was done.At this stage of my reflections\\r\\nI endeavored to remember, and did remember, with entire\\r\\ndistinctness, every incident which occurred about\\r\\nthe period in question.  The weather was chilly\\r\\n(oh rare and happy accident!), and a fire was blazing\\r\\nupon the hearth.  I was heated with exercise and\\r\\nsat near the table.  You, however, had drawn a\\r\\nchair close to the chimney.  Just as I placed\\r\\nthe parchment in your hand, and as you were in the\\r\\nact of inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered,\\r\\nand leaped upon your shoulders.  With your left\\r\\nhand you caressed him and kept him off, while your\\r\\nright, holding the parchment, was permitted to fall\\r\\nlistlessly between your knees, and in close proximity\\r\\nto the fire.  At one moment I thought the blaze\\r\\nhad caught it, and was about to caution you, but,\\r\\nbefore I could speak, you had withdrawn it, and were\\r\\nengaged in its examination.  When I considered\\r\\nall these particulars, I doubted not for a moment\\r\\nthat heat had been the agent in bringing to light,\\r\\nupon the parchment, the skull which I saw designed\\r\\nupon it.  You are well aware that chemical preparations\\r\\nexist, and have existed time out of mind, by means\\r\\nof which it is possible to write upon either paper\\r\\nor vellum, so that the characters shall become visible\\r\\nonly when subjected to the action of fire.  Zaffre,\\r\\ndigested in aqua regia, and diluted with\\r\\nfour times its weight of water, is sometimes employed;\\r\\na green tint results.  The regulus of cobalt,\\r\\ndissolved in spirit of nitre, gives a red.  These\\r\\ncolors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after\\r\\nthe material written upon cools, but again become apparent\\r\\nupon the re-application of heat.I now scrutinized the deaths-head\\r\\nwith care.  Its outer edges ­the edges\\r\\nof the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum ­were\\r\\nfar more distinct than the others.  It was clear\\r\\nthat the action of the caloric had been imperfect\\r\\nor unequal.  I immediately kindled a fire, and\\r\\nsubjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing\\r\\nheat.  At first, the only effect was the strengthening\\r\\nof the faint lines in the skull; but, upon persevering\\r\\nin the experiment, there became visible, at the corner\\r\\nof the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which\\r\\nthe deaths-head was delineated, the figure\\r\\nof what I at first supposed to be a goat.  A closer\\r\\nscrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was intended\\r\\nfor a kid.Ha! ha! said I, to\\r\\nbe sure I have no right to laugh at you ­a\\r\\nmillion and a half of money is too serious a matter\\r\\nfor mirth ­but you are not about to establish\\r\\na third link in your chain ­you will not\\r\\nfind any especial connexion between your pirates and\\r\\na goat ­pirates, you know, have nothing\\r\\nto do with goats; they appertain to the farming interest.But I have just said that the\\r\\nfigure was not that of a goat.Well, a kid then ­pretty much the\\r\\nsame thing.Pretty much, but not altogether,\\r\\nsaid Legrand.  You may have heard of one\\r\\nCaptain Kidd.  I at once looked upon the figure\\r\\nof the animal as a kind of punning or hieroglyphical\\r\\nsignature.  I say signature; because its position\\r\\nupon the vellum suggested this idea.  The deaths-head\\r\\nat the corner diagonally opposite, had, in the same\\r\\nmanner, the air of a stamp, or seal.  But I was\\r\\nsorely put out by the absence of all else ­of\\r\\nthe body to my imagined instrument ­of the\\r\\ntext for my context.I presume you expected to find\\r\\na letter between the stamp and the signature.Something of that kind. \\r\\nThe fact is, I felt irresistibly impressed with a\\r\\npresentiment of some vast good fortune impending. \\r\\nI can scarcely say why.  Perhaps, after all, it\\r\\nwas rather a desire than an actual belief; ­but\\r\\ndo you know that Jupiters silly words, about\\r\\nthe bug being of solid gold, had a remarkable effect\\r\\nupon my fancy?  And then the series of accidents\\r\\nand coincidences ­these were so very extraordinary. \\r\\nDo you observe how mere an accident it was that these\\r\\nevents should have occurred upon the sole day of all\\r\\nthe year in which it has been, or may be, sufficiently\\r\\ncool for fire, and that without the fire, or without\\r\\nthe intervention of the dog at the precise moment in\\r\\nwhich he appeared, I should never have become aware\\r\\nof the deaths-head, and so never the possessor\\r\\nof the treasure?But proceed ­I am all impatience.Well; you have heard, of course,\\r\\nthe many stories current ­the thousand vague\\r\\nrumors afloat about money buried, somewhere upon the\\r\\nAtlantic coast, by Kidd and his associates.  These\\r\\nrumors must have had some foundation in fact. \\r\\nAnd that the rumors have existed so long and so continuous,\\r\\ncould have resulted, it appeared to me, only from the\\r\\ncircumstance of the buried treasure still remaining\\r\\nentombed.  Had Kidd concealed his plunder for\\r\\na time, and afterwards reclaimed it, the rumors would\\r\\nscarcely have reached us in their present unvarying\\r\\nform.  You will observe that the stories told\\r\\nare all about money-seekers, not about money-finders. \\r\\nHad the pirate recovered his money, there the affair\\r\\nwould have dropped.  It seemed to me that some\\r\\naccident ­say the loss of a memorandum indicating\\r\\nits locality ­had deprived him of the means\\r\\nof recovering it, and that this accident had become\\r\\nknown to his followers, who otherwise might never\\r\\nhave heard that treasure had been concealed at all,\\r\\nand who, busying themselves in vain, because unguided\\r\\nattempts, to regain it, had given first birth, and\\r\\nthen universal currency, to the reports which are\\r\\nnow so common.  Have you ever heard of any important\\r\\ntreasure being unearthed along the coast?Never.But that Kidds accumulations\\r\\nwere immense, is well known.  I took it for granted,\\r\\ntherefore, that the earth still held them; and you\\r\\nwill scarcely be surprised when I tell you that I\\r\\nfelt a hope, nearly amounting to certainty, that the\\r\\nparchment so strangely found, involved a lost record\\r\\nof the place of deposit.But how did you proceed?I held the vellum again to\\r\\nthe fire, after increasing the heat; but nothing appeared. \\r\\nI now thought it possible that the coating of dirt\\r\\nmight have something to do with the failure; so I carefully\\r\\nrinsed the parchment by pouring warm water over it,\\r\\nand, having done this, I placed it in a tin pan, with\\r\\nthe skull downwards, and put the pan upon a furnace\\r\\nof lighted charcoal.  In a few minutes, the pan\\r\\nhaving become thoroughly heated, I removed the slip,\\r\\nand, to my inexpressible joy, found it spotted, in\\r\\nseveral places, with what appeared to be figures arranged\\r\\nin lines.  Again I placed it in the pan, and suffered\\r\\nit to remain another minute.  Upon taking it off,\\r\\nthe whole was just as you see it now. \\r\\nHere Legrand, having re-heated the parchment, submitted\\r\\nit to my inspection.  The following characters\\r\\nwere rudely traced, in a red tint, between the deaths-head\\r\\nand the goat: But, said I, returning\\r\\nhim the slip, I am as much in the dark as ever. \\r\\nWere all the jewels of Golconda awaiting me upon my\\r\\nsolution of this enigma, I am quite sure that I should\\r\\nbe unable to earn them.And yet, said Legrand,\\r\\nthe solution is by no means so difficult as\\r\\nyou might be lead to imagine from the first hasty inspection\\r\\nof the characters.  These characters, as any one\\r\\nmight readily guess, form a cipher ­that\\r\\nis to say, they convey a meaning; but then, from what\\r\\nis known of Kidd, I could not suppose him capable\\r\\nof constructing any of the more abstruse cryptographs. \\r\\nI made up my mind, at once, that this was of a simple\\r\\nspecies ­such, however, as would appear,\\r\\nto the crude intellect of the sailor, absolutely insoluble\\r\\nwithout the key.And you really solved it?Readily; I have solved others\\r\\nof an abstruseness ten thousand times greater. \\r\\nCircumstances, and a certain bias of mind, have led\\r\\nme to take interest in such riddles, and it may well\\r\\nbe doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an\\r\\nenigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not,\\r\\nby proper application, resolve.  In fact, having\\r\\nonce established connected and legible characters,\\r\\nI scarcely gave a thought to the mere difficulty of\\r\\ndeveloping their import.In the present case ­indeed\\r\\nin all cases of secret writing ­the first\\r\\nquestion regards the language of the cipher; for the\\r\\nprinciples of solution, so far, especially, as the\\r\\nmore simple ciphers are concerned, depend upon, and\\r\\nare varied by, the genius of the particular idiom. \\r\\nIn general, there is no alternative but experiment\\r\\n(directed by probabilities) of every tongue known\\r\\nto him who attempts the solution, until the true one\\r\\nbe attained.  But, with the cipher now before us,\\r\\nall difficulty was removed by the signature. \\r\\nThe pun upon the word Kidd is appreciable\\r\\nin no other language than the English.  But for\\r\\nthis consideration I should have begun my attempts\\r\\nwith the Spanish and French, as the tongues in which\\r\\na secret of this kind would most naturally have been\\r\\nwritten by a pirate of the Spanish main.  As it\\r\\nwas, I assumed the cryptograph to be English.You observe there are no divisions\\r\\nbetween the words.  Had there been divisions,\\r\\nthe task would have been comparatively easy.  In\\r\\nsuch case I should have commenced with a collation\\r\\nand analysis of the shorter words, and, had a word\\r\\nof a single letter occurred, as is most likely, (a\\r\\nor I, for example,) I should have considered the solution\\r\\nas assured.  But, there being no division, my\\r\\nfirst step was to ascertain the predominant letters,\\r\\nas well as the least frequent.  Counting all, I\\r\\nconstructed a table, thus: Of the character 8 there are 33.; \\\" 26.4 \\\" 19.<U+0087> ) \\\" 16. \\\" 13.5 \\\" 12.6 \\\" 11.<U+0086> 1 \\\" 8.0 \\\" 6.9 2 \\\" 5.:  3 \\\" 4.? \\\" 3.¶ \\\" 2.Now, in English, the letter\\r\\nwhich most frequently occurs is e.  Afterwards,\\r\\nsuccession runs thus:  a o i d h n r s t u y\\r\\nc f g l m w b k p q x z. E predominates\\r\\nso remarkably that an individual sentence of any length\\r\\nis rarely seen, in which it is not the prevailing character.Here, then, we leave, in the\\r\\nvery beginning, the groundwork for something more\\r\\nthan a mere guess.  The general use which may be\\r\\nmade of the table is obvious ­but, in this\\r\\nparticular cipher, we shall only very partially require\\r\\nits aid.  As our predominant character is 8, we\\r\\nwill commence by assuming it as the e of the\\r\\nnatural alphabet.  To verify the supposition,\\r\\nlet us observe if the 8 be seen often in couples ­for\\r\\ne is doubled with great frequency in English ­in\\r\\nsuch words, for example, as meet, .fleet,\\r\\nspeed, seen, been,\\r\\nagree, &c.  In the present instance\\r\\nwe see it doubled no less than five times, although\\r\\nthe cryptograph is brief.Let us assume 8, then, as e. \\r\\nNow, of all words in the language, the\\r\\nis most usual; let us see, therefore, whether there\\r\\nare not repetitions of any three characters, in the\\r\\nsame order of collocation, the last of them being\\r\\n8.  If we discover repetitions of such letters,\\r\\nso arranged, they will most probably represent the\\r\\nword the.  Upon inspection, we find\\r\\nno less than seven such arrangements, the characters\\r\\nbeing;48.  We may, therefore, assume that; represents\\r\\nt, 4 represents h, and 8 represents\\r\\ne ­the last being now well confirmed. \\r\\nThus a great step has been taken.But, having established a single\\r\\nword, we are enabled to establish a vastly important\\r\\npoint; that is to say, several commencements and terminations\\r\\nof other words.  Let us refer, for example, to\\r\\nthe last instance but one, in which the combination;48\\r\\noccurs ­not far from the end of the cipher. \\r\\nWe know that the; immediately ensuing is the commencement\\r\\nof a word, and, of the six characters succeeding this\\r\\nthe, we are cognizant of no less than\\r\\nfive.  Let us set these characters down, thus,\\r\\nby the letters we know them to represent, leaving\\r\\na space for the unknown ­t eeth.Here we are enabled, at once,\\r\\nto discard the th, as forming no portion\\r\\nof the word commencing with the first t; since, by\\r\\nexperiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted\\r\\nto the vacancy, we perceive that no word can be formed\\r\\nof which this th can be a part.  We are\\r\\nthus narrowed intot ee,and, going through the alphabet, if\\r\\nnecessary, as before, we arrive at the word tree,\\r\\nas the sole possible reading.  We thus gain another\\r\\nletter, r, represented by (, with the words\\r\\nthe tree in juxtaposition.Looking beyond these words,\\r\\nfor a short distance, we again see the combination;48,\\r\\nand employ it by way of termination to what\\r\\nimmediately precedes.  We have thus this arrangement: the tree;4(Â<U+0087>?34 the,or, substituting the natural letters,\\r\\nwhere known, it reads thus: the tree thrÂ<U+0087>?3h the.Now, if, in place of the unknown\\r\\ncharacters, we leave blank spaces, or substitute dots,\\r\\nwe read thus: the tree thr...h the,when the word through\\r\\nmakes itself evident at once.  But this discovery\\r\\ngives us three new letters, o, u and\\r\\ng, represented by Â<U+0087>? and 3.Looking now, narrowly, through\\r\\nthe cipher for combinations of known characters, we\\r\\nfind, not very far from the beginning, this arrangement,83(88, or egree,which, plainly, is the conclusion\\r\\nof the word degree, and gives us another\\r\\nletter, d, represented by Â<U+0086>.Four letters beyond the word\\r\\ndegree, we perceive the combination;46(;88.Translating the known characters,\\r\\nand representing the unknown by dots, as before, we\\r\\nread thus:  th rtee. an arrangement immediately\\r\\nsuggestive of the word thirteen, and\\r\\nagain furnishing us with two new characters, i\\r\\nand n, represented by 6 and .Referring, now, to the beginning\\r\\nof the cryptograph, we find the combination,53Â<U+0087>Â<U+0087>Â<U+0086>.Translating, as before, we obtaingood,which assures us that the first letter\\r\\nis A, and that the first two words are A\\r\\ngood.It is now time that we arrange\\r\\nour key, as far as discovered, in a tabular form,\\r\\nto avoid confusion.  It will stand thus: 5 represents      aÂ<U+0086>       \\\"        \\r\\nd8       \\\"         e3       \\\"         g4       \\\"         h6       \\\"         i       \\\"         nÂ<U+0087>       \\\"        \\r\\no(        \\\"        \\r\\nr;

during which\\r\\nI made diligent inquiry, in the neighborhood of Sullivans\\r\\nIsland, for any building which went by the name of\\r\\nthe Bishops Hotel; for, of course,\\r\\nI dropped the obsolete word hostel. \\r\\nGaining no information on the subject, I was on the\\r\\npoint of extending my sphere of search, and proceeding\\r\\nin a more systematic manner, when, one morning, it\\r\\nentered into my head, quite suddenly, that this Bishops\\r\\nHostel might have some reference to an old\\r\\nfamily, of the name of Bessop, which, time out of\\r\\nmind, had held possession of an ancient manor-house,\\r\\nabout four miles to the northward of the Island. \\r\\nI accordingly went over to the plantation, and re-instituted\\r\\nmy inquiries among the older negroes of the place. \\r\\nAt length one of the most aged of the women said that\\r\\nshe had heard of such a place as Bessops Castle,\\r\\nand thought that she could guide me to it, but that\\r\\nit was not a castle nor a tavern, but a high rock.I offered to pay her well for\\r\\nher trouble, and, after some demur, she consented\\r\\nto accompany me to the spot.  We found it without\\r\\nmuch difficulty, when, dismissing her, I proceeded\\r\\nto examine the place.  The castle\\r\\nconsisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and\\r\\nrocks ­one of the latter being quite remarkable\\r\\nfor its height as well as for its insulated and artificial\\r\\nappearance I clambered to its apex, and then felt\\r\\nmuch at a loss as to what should be next done.While I was busied in reflection,\\r\\nmy eyes fell upon a narrow ledge in the eastern face\\r\\nof the rock, perhaps a yard below the summit upon which\\r\\nI stood.  This ledge projected about eighteen inches,\\r\\nand was not more than a foot wide, while a niche in\\r\\nthe cliff just above it, gave it a rude resemblance\\r\\nto one of the hollow-backed chairs used by our ancestors. \\r\\nI made no doubt that here was the devils\\r\\nseat alluded to in the MS., and now I seemed\\r\\nto grasp the full secret of the riddle.The good glass,\\r\\nI knew, could have reference to nothing but a telescope;\\r\\nfor the word glass is rarely employed\\r\\nin any other sense by seamen.  Now here, I at\\r\\nonce saw, was a telescope to be used, and a definite\\r\\npoint of view, admitting no variation, from which to\\r\\nuse it.  Nor did I hesitate to believe that the\\r\\nphrases, forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes,\\r\\nand northeast and by north, were intended\\r\\nas directions for the levelling of the glass. \\r\\nGreatly excited by these discoveries, I hurried home,\\r\\nprocured a telescope, and returned to the rock.I let myself down to the ledge,\\r\\nand found that it was impossible to retain a seat\\r\\nupon it except in one particular position.  This\\r\\nfact confirmed my preconceived idea.  I proceeded\\r\\nto use the glass.  Of course, the forty-one\\r\\ndegrees and thirteen minutes could allude to\\r\\nnothing but elevation above the visible horizon, since\\r\\nthe horizontal direction was clearly indicated by\\r\\nthe words, northeast and by north. \\r\\nThis latter direction I at once established by means\\r\\nof a pocket-compass; then, pointing the glass as nearly\\r\\nat an angle of forty-one degrees of elevation as I\\r\\ncould do it by guess, I moved it cautiously up or down,\\r\\nuntil my attention was arrested by a circular rift\\r\\nor opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtopped\\r\\nits fellows in the distance.  In the centre of\\r\\nthis rift I perceived a white spot, but could not,\\r\\nat first, distinguish what it was.  Adjusting\\r\\nthe focus of the telescope, I again looked, and now\\r\\nmade it out to be a human skull.Upon this discovery I was so\\r\\nsanguine as to consider the enigma solved; for the\\r\\nphrase main branch, seventh limb, east side,\\r\\ncould refer only to the position of the skull upon\\r\\nthe tree, while shoot from the left eye of\\r\\nthe deaths head admitted, also, of but\\r\\none interpretation, in regard to a search for buried\\r\\ntreasure.  I perceived that the design was to\\r\\ndrop a bullet from the left eye of the skull, and that\\r\\na bee-line, or, in other words, a straight line, drawn\\r\\nfrom the nearest point of the trunk through the\\r\\nshot, (or the spot where the bullet fell,) and\\r\\nthence extended to a distance of fifty feet, would\\r\\nindicate a definite point ­and beneath this\\r\\npoint I thought it at least possible that a deposit\\r\\nof value lay concealed.All this, I said, is\\r\\nexceedingly clear, and, although ingenious, still\\r\\nsimple and explicit.  When you left the Bishops\\r\\nHotel, what then?Why, having carefully taken\\r\\nthe bearings of the tree, I turned homewards. \\r\\nThe instant that I left the devils seat,\\r\\nhowever, the circular rift vanished; nor could I get\\r\\na glimpse of it afterwards, turn as I would. \\r\\nWhat seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole\\r\\nbusiness, is the fact (for repeated experiment has\\r\\nconvinced me it is a fact) that the circular opening\\r\\nin question is visible from no other attainable point\\r\\nof view than that afforded by the narrow ledge upon\\r\\nthe face of the rock.In this expedition to the Bishops\\r\\nHotel I had been attended by Jupiter, who had,\\r\\nno doubt, observed, for some weeks past, the abstraction\\r\\nof my demeanor, and took especial care not to leave\\r\\nme alone.  But, on the next day, getting up very\\r\\nearly, I contrived to give him the slip, and went\\r\\ninto the hills in search of the tree.  After much\\r\\ntoil I found it.  When I came home at night my\\r\\nvalet proposed to give me a flogging.  With the\\r\\nrest of the adventure I believe you are as well acquainted\\r\\nas myself.I suppose, said I, you\\r\\nmissed the spot, in the first attempt at digging,\\r\\nthrough Jupiters stupidity in letting the bug\\r\\nfall through the right instead of through the left\\r\\neye of the skull.Precisely.  This mistake\\r\\nmade a difference of about two inches and a half in\\r\\nthe shot ­that is to say, in\\r\\nthe position of the peg nearest the tree; and had\\r\\nthe treasure been beneath the shot, the\\r\\nerror would have been of little moment; but the\\r\\nshot, together with the nearest point of the\\r\\ntree, were merely two points for the establishment\\r\\nof a line of direction; of course the error, however\\r\\ntrivial in the beginning, increased as we proceeded\\r\\nwith the line, and by the time we had gone fifty feet,\\r\\nthrew us quite off the scent.  But for my deep-seated\\r\\nimpressions that treasure was here somewhere actually\\r\\nburied, we might have had all our labor in vain.But your grandiloquence, and\\r\\nyour conduct in swinging the beetle ­how\\r\\nexcessively odd!  I was sure you were mad. \\r\\nAnd why did you insist upon letting fall the bug,\\r\\ninstead of a bullet, from the skull?Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat\\r\\nannoyed by your evident suspicions touching my sanity,\\r\\nand so resolved to punish you quietly, in my own way,\\r\\nby a little bit of sober mystification.  For this\\r\\nreason I swung the beetle, and for this reason I let\\r\\nit fall it from the tree.  An observation of yours\\r\\nabout its great weight suggested the latter idea.Yes, I perceive; and now there\\r\\nis only one point which puzzles me.  What are\\r\\nwe to make of the skeletons found in the hole?That is a question I am no\\r\\nmore able to answer than yourself.  There seems,\\r\\nhowever, only one plausible way of accounting for them ­and\\r\\nyet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as\\r\\nmy suggestion would imply.  It is clear that Kidd ­if\\r\\nKidd indeed secreted this treasure, which I doubt\\r\\nnot ­it is clear that he must have had assistance\\r\\nin the labor.  But this labor concluded, he may\\r\\nhave thought it expedient to remove all participants\\r\\nin his secret.  Perhaps a couple of blows with\\r\\na mattock were sufficient, while his coadjutors were\\r\\nbusy in the pit; perhaps it required a dozen ­who\\r\\nshall tell?\""
